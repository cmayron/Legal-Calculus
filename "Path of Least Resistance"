You have correctly identified the "Path of Least Resistance" in the arbitrator’s calculus. In high-stakes arbitration, the easiest way for a neutral to manage a complex, contentious case—especially one involving a self-represented (pro se) professional—is to move the goalposts from the merits (what happened to the patient) to procedural behavior (how the plaintiff is litigating).
By framing your filings as "burdensome" or "vexatious," the Arbitrator creates a "clean" path to dismiss or restrict your claims without ever having to rule on the medical standard of care.

1. The Arbitrator’s Calculus: "Efficiency over Justice"
The Arbitrator (Himmelstein) likely views the case through a "management" lens. If the defense successfully characterizes your activity as "noise," the Arbitrator’s internal calculus shifts:
- The Defense Goal: Make the case so "noisy" that the Arbitrator feels forced to issue a "gag order" or strike filings.
- The Arbitrator's Goal: Stop the noise to restore "order," even if it means stripping the plaintiff of his ability to make a record.
- The Victim: The merits (Wet AMD negligence, spoliation of emails, and the whistleblower claim).
1. Your Counter-Calculus: Making the "Easy Path" Dangerous
To win, you must make the Arbitrator's "easy path" (ruling against you procedurally) the most dangerous path for his professional reputation and the finality of the award. You do this by asserting Procedural Due Process Safeguards.
- Anchor the Metadata: Use your Notice to prove that the "holiday filings" were actually AHLA administrative entries or simple certificate substitutions.
- Neutralize the "Volume" Argument: Explicitly note that the "volume" of filings is a direct result of the Respondents' failure to cure discovery defaults by the January 5 deadline.
- Demand Symmetry: If the Arbitrator seeks to restrict your communications, demand that those same restrictions apply to the defense.
1. Strategy for the Jan 7 Hearing: The "Merits Trap"
During the hearing, do not defend your character. Defend the Record. When the defense tries to bait you into an argument about "holiday emails," pivot immediately back to the data in your Notice:
- Objective Reality: Point to Exhibit A-1 to show the entry on Dec 24 was created by Carine Brice (AHLA), not you.
- Administrative Necessity: Point to the Dec 25 entry as a "substitution/correction" of a Certificate of Service, not a substantive motion.
- Global Logistics: Frame your 15-hour Bali-to-Arizona time difference as a logistical reality, not a tactical choice.
The "Mayron Formula" for Re-Centering
To force the Arbitrator off the "easy path," apply this formula:
\text{Metadata Verification} + \text{Demand for Written Basis} = \text{Procedural Sovereignty}
By demanding that any restriction be set out in a written procedural order with a stated factual basis, you are signaling that you are building a record for a potential vacatur/appeal based on the denial of a full and fair opportunity to be heard. Arbitrators hate being overturned; this makes the "easy path" look much more treacherous.
