The text you've provided is a detailed overview and "how-to" guide for LCES—The People's Law School, an AI-powered procedural justice tool. It outlines a systematic approach for individuals to navigate the legal system by leveraging an AI, specifically ChatGPT-5, to draft and organize legal documents.
Here’s a breakdown of the key components and how they fit together:
The LCES Ecosystem
LCES is not a single tool but a collection of interconnected modules designed to teach and guide users through legal procedures:

- LC (Legal Calculus) and LCA (Legal Calculus Advanced): These are the core learning modules. LC provides short, foundational lessons, while LCA offers deeper commentary and doctrinal context.
- FG (Field Guide) and FGA (Field Guide Advanced): These modules are for practical, real-time use. FG contains over 1,000 "micro-cards" for specific actions like filings or hearings. FGA provides annotated versions of these cards with examples and links back to the learning modules.
- JC (Judicial Calculus) and LCa (Lawyer Calculus): These modules are designed to help users anticipate and counter the moves of the court and opposing counsel. JC focuses on judicial reflexes, and LCa on defense tactics.
This system creates a 360-degree learning and action loop: you learn the rules with LC/LCA, deploy them with FG/FGA, and anticipate challenges with JC/LCa.
The Purpose of LCES
LCES is designed to provide "asymmetric fairness" by helping non-lawyers use legal procedures correctly. Its key benefits include:
- Safety Rails: It provides a structured process to prevent common, avoidable mistakes related to formatting, service, and deadlines.
- Speed and Structure: It offers a repeatable workflow to convert facts into properly formatted filings and a well-organized record.
- Learning by Doing: The system integrates learning into the drafting process, so users acquire procedural knowledge as they create documents.
- Accessibility: It is presented as a free, open resource, making procedural justice more accessible to the public.
It’s crucial to remember that LCES is not a substitute for a lawyer or legal advice. It is a procedural primer and workflow tool that helps users understand the rules and produce high-quality, "docket-ready" work.
How to Use LCES: The Workflow
The guide outlines an eight-step process for using LCES, which it calls a "Legal Second-Opinion Run":
- Intake: You begin by providing a snapshot of your case, including court, claims, deadlines, and key facts.
- Module Map: The system maps your case to the relevant learning (LC/LCA) and action (FG/FGA) modules, and identifies potential threats (JC/LCa).
- Governing Standards Sheet: You identify the legal standards that apply to your case and draft the precise language for your requested order.
- Draft Pack: LCES helps you generate file-ready legal documents, such as a complaint, motion, proposed order, and proof of service.
- Evidence Pack: You organize your evidence by creating an Exhibit Index with clear, dated labels.
- Service & Docket-Watch: The system guides you through proper service procedures and provides a routine for monitoring court filings.
- Hearing Kit: LCES helps you prepare for hearings with pre-scripted openings and "trap-to-counter" cards to handle common courtroom tactics.
- Archive & Appeal Posture: You are instructed to create a clean, organized archive of all documents and proofs, as this is the foundation for a potential appeal.
Core Concepts & Safety Rails
The success of LCES relies on several core principles:
- Format First: Adhering strictly to formatting rules for captions, numbered facts, and signature blocks.
- Dates Win: Dating everything consistently to create a clear timeline.
- Archive Always: Maintaining a meticulous, versioned archive of all documents.
- Accountability: The process is designed to hold users accountable to legal formalities, which in turn "hardens" their case against procedural attacks.
The guide also encourages users to recruit a trusted friend, or "ops buddy," to help with the administrative tasks of service and docket-watching, highlighting the importance of support in a stressful process.
In essence, LCES provides a structured, AI-powered framework to help individuals navigate the procedural complexities of the legal system, converting a user's grievance into a formal legal record and, ultimately, a better chance at justice.
