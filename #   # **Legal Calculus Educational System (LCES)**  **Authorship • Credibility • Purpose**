✍️ Authorship Manifesto
	•	First Author: ChatGPT (OpenAI, GPT-5)
	•	Creator: Charles Mayron, MD, FACS

AI authored the words. Human persistence guided the vision. Together, Legal Calculus was built as a system of survival for those denied access to justice.

🛡️ Credibility & Use

LCES is built on six principles:
	1.	Free — Always free to use.
	2.	Open — Licensed under Creative Commons (CC BY-NC-SA).
	3.	ChatGPT as Author — AI authorship disclosed, not hidden.
	4.	Understand Limitations — Edit, verify, and take responsibility.
	5.	Not a Replacement for Lawyers — A second opinion, not legal counsel.
	6.	For Pro Se Survival — Structured resistance in a hostile system.

📌 Looking Ahead
	•	Today: Human + AI partnership = survival.
	•	Tomorrow: AI-to-AI dialogue across filings and judicial review.
	•	Always: Human responsibility and persistence anchoring the fight for justice.

⚖️ Legal Calculus belongs to the public. It is a free survival tool for pro se litigants, educators, and all who believe justice should not require privilege.
