**FG5-0001 → FG5-1000 · “Thinking 5.0” Edition**

# **What’s new in 5.0 (the big upgrades)**

THINK5 loop inside every card:

- T — Trigger: what just happened that matters?
- H — Hypotheses: what are the plausible legal frames/risks?
- I — Inputs: evidence, rules, deadlines, record cites.
- N — Navigation: concrete moves (filings, requests, scripts).
- K — Knowledge: what to learn & memorialize for appeal.

Ops Blocks in every card:

- Filing Moves (ready-to-use one-liners/skeletons)
- Evidence Ledger (what to capture & how)
- Risk/Cost (Impact/Effort/Risk score 1–5)
- Timeline (when to do the thing)
- Reusable Snippet (drop-in sentence/paragraph)
- Automation Prompt (so you can set reminders/checks)

# Use: 20 volumes × 50 cards = 1000 cards. Below are (1) a universal template, (2) a compact schema if you want to generate or databind, and (3) 20 fully-authored “anchor cards” (one per 50-card band: 001, 050, …, 1000) to set the tone. You can spin up the remaining cards by cloning these patterns.
