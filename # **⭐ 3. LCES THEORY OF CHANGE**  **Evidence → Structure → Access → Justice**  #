# **Theory of Change: How Legal Calculus Makes Justice Possible**

The Problem:

Justice is inaccessible because it is unaffordable.

And when justice is unaffordable, the system relies on procedure to absorb frustration instead of resolving truth.

The Insight:

You cannot change the system with emotion.

You change it by understanding its physics.

The Theory of Change:

**Step 1 — Evidence-Based Law**

Measure what actually happens in courts.

Document patterns.

See the structure clearly.

**Step 2 — Legal Calculus (The WHY)**

Translate the system into principles:

- Format is power
- Procedure protects truth
- Affordability is the foundation
- AI is the equalizer

**Step 3 — Field Guide (The HOW)**

Give people:

- templates,
- procedures,
- interventions,
- rescue tools,
- filing structures,
- timelines,
- checklists.

**Step 4 — Practical Access (The Impact)**

When people can format, file, and document,

they gain access.

When they gain access,

justice becomes possible.

Justice happens when people can enter the system and survive it.

Legal Calculus makes that possible.
