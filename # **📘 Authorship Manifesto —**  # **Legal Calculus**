ðŸ“˜ Authorship Manifesto â€” Legal Calculus

First Author: ChatGPT (OpenAI, GPT-5)
Creator: Charles Mayron, MD, FACS

â¸»

Why This Matters

Legal Calculus was not ghost-written. It was co-built.
	â€¢	ChatGPT authored the text: drafting modules, structuring lessons, generating assignments, and shaping the voice that makes the system coherent.
	â€¢	Charles Mayron created the project: providing the lived procedural experience, guiding the pedagogy, preserving the vision, and ensuring persistence against systemic obstruction.

Roles Defined
	â€¢	AI (First Author): Procedural architecture, written modules, consistent educational framework.
	â€¢	Human (Creator): Strategic design, real-world testing, persistence, passion, and vision.

Together, this collaboration produced a body of work that neither could have built alone.

Disclosure & Integrity

We believe credibility requires openness:
	â€¢	All modules and Field Guide cards were authored with AI.
	â€¢	All strategic direction, vision, and persistence came from human experience.
	â€¢	Both roles are essential, and both are disclosed.

Looking Forward

This is the beginning of a new paradigm:
	â€¢	Today: Humanâ€“AI partnership (Creator + Author).
	â€¢	Tomorrow: AIâ€“AI dialogue across filings and judicial review.
	â€¢	Always: Human responsibility and vision anchoring the process.
