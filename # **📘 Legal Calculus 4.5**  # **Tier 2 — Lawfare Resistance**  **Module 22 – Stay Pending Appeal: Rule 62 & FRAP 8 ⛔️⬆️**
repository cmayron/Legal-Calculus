Module 22 – Stay Pending Appeal: Rule 62 & FRAP 8 ⛔️⬆️

⚖️ Core Message

A timely, well‑supported stay prevents a judgment from taking effect while you appeal. Ask the right court, use the correct standard, and secure the judgment (bond or other security) to protect your position.

📖 Lesson Content

·       Where to Move 🧭 — Move first in the district court (FRAP 8(a)(1)). If denied or impracticable, move in the court of appeals (FRAP 8(a)(2)) and attach the district‑court order and relevant parts of the record.

·       What to Show 📏 — Courts apply the familiar factors (Nken/Winter): (1) likelihood of success on appeal; (2) irreparable harm without a stay; (3) harm to other parties; and (4) public interest. Be specific and record‑supported.

·       Rule 62 Basics 🧱 — 62(a): automatic stay of execution for 30 days after judgment. 62(b): stay by bond or other security (often used for money judgments). 62(d): injunction pending appeal—court may suspend/modify/restore/grant an injunction during the appeal.

·       Security 💳 — Propose a supersedeas bond or alternative security (escrow, insurer guarantee). Explain amount and why it fully protects the appellee but is not punitive.

·       Administrative Stay ⏲️ — Ask for a short administrative stay (e.g., 7–14 days) to allow full stay briefing or to preserve the status quo while the court considers the motion.

·       Order of Operations ✅ — File your Notice of Appeal on time; then (or concurrently) file a stay motion in district court with a narrowly tailored proposed order and evidence of security.
