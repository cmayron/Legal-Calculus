Module 1 – Filing is Protest ✊📄

⸻

⚖️ Core Message

Filing is not simply a request for relief.
It is a declaration that the matter exists, that you exist, and that injustice cannot be ignored.

⸻

📖 Lesson Content
	•	Filing as Existence 📝 — Courts cannot act on what is not in the record. If it isn’t filed, it didn’t happen.
	•	Filing as Leverage ⚖️ — Every filing forces both the court and the opposing side to respond. It creates obligation where otherwise there is silence.
	•	Filing as Legacy 📚 — Even if denied, a filing becomes part of the permanent record. Today’s protest can become tomorrow’s precedent.

⸻

📝 Assignment

Draft a one-page Notice of Filing that:
	1.	States clearly what you are filing.
	2.	Declares why you are filing it (existence + preservation).
	3.	Uses neutral, procedural language — but still makes your protest unmistakable.

✅ Model Answer (Example)

NOTICE OF FILING

Plaintiff hereby gives notice of filing the attached [Motion for Temporary Restraining Order]. This filing is made to ensure the matter is preserved on the record, to provide notice to the Court and Defendants, and to affirm that Plaintiff’s rights and grievances are properly before this Court.

Respectfully submitted,
/s/ [Your Name]
Date: [Insert Date]

💡 Reflection

Every system depends on memory. Courts depend on the docket. Filing is how you create existence inside that system. Even if no relief comes immediately, the act of filing is a strategic seed: it forces memory, it forces recognition, and it builds the archive that may outlive the moment.
