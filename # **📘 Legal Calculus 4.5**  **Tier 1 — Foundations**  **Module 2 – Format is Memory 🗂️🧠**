Module 2 – Format is Memory 🗂️🧠

⸻

⚖️ Core Message

Format is not decoration.
It is the architecture of legal memory — the structure that ensures your words survive, are noticed, and can be acted upon.

⸻

📖 Lesson Content
	•	Format as Signal 📡 — Courts read structure before they read content. A well-formatted filing signals seriousness and demands attention.
	•	Format as Survival 🛡️ — Without proper captions, signatures, or certificates, filings vanish into the void. Format protects against erasure.
	•	Format as Force 💥 — Structure turns narrative into legal action. A story becomes a motion; a grievance becomes a claim.

⸻

📝 Assignment

Take a two-paragraph statement of grievance (informal language, e.g., “the judge ignored my evidence”) and rewrite it into a properly formatted Motion that contains:
	1.	Caption and title.
	2.	Statement of facts.
	3.	Relief requested.
	4.	Signature block.

💡 Reflection

Format is not the enemy of substance — it is what makes substance usable. Courts cannot hold memory without structure. For pro se litigants, format is the bridge: it translates lived reality into procedural existence.

🎨 Visual Pairing

Image Concept: A filing cabinet with folders labeled “Motion,” “Complaint,” and “Notice.” Next to it sits a messy pile of loose papers fading into dust. Caption: “Format is Memory.”
