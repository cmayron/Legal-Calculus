Module 5 – Relief Requested = Relief Possible 🎯📑

⸻

⚖️ Core Message

Courts can only grant what is asked for.
If your relief is unclear, missing, or improperly framed, the court will not supply it for you. Relief requested defines relief possible.

⸻

📖 Lesson Content
	•	Relief as Boundary 🚧 — Judges cannot award remedies not requested. Your “ask” defines the edges of judicial power.
	•	Relief as Strategy 🎯 — Narrow, precise requests are harder to deny. Overbroad or vague requests invite rejection.
	•	Relief as Preservation 🧾 — Even if denied, a properly framed request sets up the appeal. Relief requested = issue preserved.

⸻

📝 Assignment

Draft a Proposed Order for a simple motion (e.g., Motion to Extend Time). Ensure it includes:
	1.	Caption and title.
	2.	A short “IT IS ORDERED” clause granting the relief.
	3.	A signature line for the judge.

💡 Reflection

Relief is the hinge between effort and outcome. A court cannot grant justice it is not asked to grant. For pro se litigants, clarity in the relief requested is both shield and sword: it prevents dismissal for vagueness and secures appellate preservation.
