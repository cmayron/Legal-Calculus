Module 7 – Silence Is Strategy 🤐⚔️

⸻

⚖️ Core Message

Silence in litigation is not absence.
It is often a deliberate tactic — used by courts and opposing counsel alike — to shift pressure, delay relief, or erase claims.

⸻

📖 Lesson Content
	•	Silence as Delay ⏳ — Clerks or judges may “hold” filings without docketing, forcing you into procedural limbo.
	•	Silence as Denial 🚫 — Courts sometimes deny without words: failing to rule, ignoring motions, or omitting exhibits from the record.
	•	Silence as Trap 🪤 — Opponents rely on pro se litigants assuming silence means victory or compliance. In truth, silence often masks strategic evasion.

⸻

📝 Assignment

Draft a Notice of Non-Response to an opponent’s silence. Your filing should:
	1.	Identify the unanswered motion or request.
	2.	Note the time elapsed.
	3.	Request that the court treat silence as waiver, consent, or grounds for decision.

✅ Model Answer (Example)

NOTICE OF NON-RESPONSE

Plaintiff hereby gives notice that Defendant has failed to file any response to Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel, filed on August 1, 2025. More than 21 days have elapsed. Defendant’s silence constitutes waiver of opposition under Rule [cite].

Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court deem the Motion to Compel unopposed and grant the relief requested therein.

Respectfully submitted,
/s/ [Your Name]
Date: [Insert Date]

💡 Reflection

Silence is not neutral. It is performance. For pro se litigants, recognizing silence as a weapon is key: every unanswered motion must itself become a filing.
