Module 8 – Delay Is Denial ⏱️🚫

⸻

⚖️ Core Message

Justice delayed is not neutral. For those without privilege, delay itself is denial — a tactic that drains resources, stalls relief, and erases urgency.

⸻

📖 Lesson Content
	•	Delay as Tactic 🐌 — Opposing counsel benefits when time runs out on whistleblowers, pro se litigants, or urgent claims.
	•	Delay as Damage 💸 — Each continuance, extension, or “administrative pause” bleeds time, money, and energy from the weaker side.
	•	Delay as Denial 🚫 — A court that never rules has already ruled. Delay can be as destructive as outright dismissal.

⸻

📝 Assignment

Draft a Motion to Expedite that:
	1.	Identifies the harm caused by delay.
	2.	Explains why time is of the essence.
	3.	Requests the court to set a hearing or decision within a defined timeline.

✅ Model Answer (Example)

MOTION TO EXPEDITE

Plaintiff respectfully moves this Court to expedite ruling on Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Plaintiff is suffering ongoing irreparable harm, including loss of employment and denial of constitutional rights, each day the Court withholds decision.

Plaintiff requests that the Court issue a ruling, or in the alternative, schedule an expedited hearing within 10 days.

Respectfully submitted,
/s/ [Your Name]
Date: [Insert Date]

💡 Reflection

Delay is a form of silent denial. The docket itself can be used to grind people down until they give up. For pro se litigants, naming delay as denial and filing against it converts waiting into strategy.
