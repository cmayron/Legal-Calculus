Module 42 – Litigation as Data: Graph the Case You’re Arguing 📈🗂️
⚖️ Core Message
Your case is a time‑series and a network: events, actors, filings, outcomes. When you graph it, patterns of delay, silence, and misrouting become evidence. Data displays make prejudice legible.

📖 Lesson Content
• Event Graphs — Build a timeline of filings, clerk actions, orders, latencies (days).
• Actor Map — Who touched what when: judge, clerk, counsel; edges labeled by action.
• Outcome Layers — Color code: docketed, returned, denied w/o findings, set for hearing.
• Evidence Pipeline — Source table (ECF/Exhibit/Hash) → CSV → chart (PNG) → Declaration.
• Use in Court — File as FRE 1006 summary exhibit with custodian declaration and CSV.
📝 Assignment
Create a 1‑page 'Case Data Sheet' with: (1) timeline table (date, event, actor, latency), (2) small network diagram caption explaining actor interactions, (3) an index linking each event to ECF/exhibit hashes.

✅ Model Answer (Template)
DECLARATION (Data Custodian)
I maintain the event ledger for this litigation. Exhibit S‑1 is a summary chart derived from the ledger (CSV attached). Underlying documents are true copies (ECF numbers cited). The latency column measures days between tender and docketing/order.
/s/ [Name] 28 U.S.C. § 1746

💡 Reflection
When you show the pattern, you don’t have to argue the pattern. Judges can see it.

🎨 Visual Pairing

Module 43 – AI Co‑Counsel Protocol: Prompt → Draft → Cite‑or‑Strike → Hash → File 🤖⚖️
⚖️ Core Message
AI makes speed possible; protocol makes it reliable. Every factual sentence needs a pin‑cite or it moves to argument. Hash what you file; log what you didn’t use.

📖 Lesson Content
• Prompt Hygiene — Give AI the record (ECF/Exhibit IDs), the standard, and the exact ask.
• Cite‑or‑Strike — Pass that removes any factual sentence lacking a pin‑cite (ECF/Exhibit/Tr.).
• Source Ledger — Table mapping sentence → source → pin‑cite → hash → reviewer/date.
• Hashing — Compute SHA‑256 for PDFs/images and list next to each exhibit in the brief.
• Audit Trail — Keep a 'discard' log to show restraint; it builds credibility.
📝 Assignment
Run an AI co‑counsel pass on a 2‑page factual section: add inline cites, build a source ledger (CSV), compute hashes, and append a short 'Protocol Compliance Declaration.'

✅ Model Answer (Template)
DECLARATION (AI Protocol)
Every factual sentence in Section II includes a pin‑cite. I computed SHA‑256 for Exhibits A–D and listed values in the ledger. Sentences without support were moved to argument or removed.
/s/ [Name] § 1746

💡 Reflection
Protocol turns 'trust me' into 'check me.' That’s how AI work product survives scrutiny.

Module 44 – Paper Hearings: Put the Hearing You Need Into the Record 📝🎙️
⚖️ Core Message
If the court won’t calendar a hearing, you can still create a 'paper hearing': questions, exhibits, and proposed findings—so the judge can rule and the record is reviewable.

📖 Lesson Content
• Question Set — Draft the five questions you would answer at oral argument—with cites.
• Mini‑Findings — Propose narrow findings of fact/law the court can adopt or reject cleanly.
• Record‑Ready — Index exhibits and pin‑cites; include a short proposed order (Option A/B).
• Notice — File as 'Hearing-by-Papers Submission' or 'Request for Ruling' per local practice.
• Review Posture — Absence of findings after a paper hearing strengthens appellate posture.
📝 Assignment
Prepare a 3‑page Paper Hearing Pack: (1) Five Questions & Answers, (2) Proposed Mini‑Findings, (3) Proposed Order (A/B), with exhibit index.

✅ Model Answer (Template)
PAPER HEARING SUBMISSION
Q1: What triggers Rule 5(d)(4)? A: Clerk refusal based solely on form… (ECF 25 at 3). [Repeat Q2–Q5].
Proposed Findings: (1) Tender shown by Ex. A; (2) Rule 5(d)(4) bars refusal…
Proposed Order: Option A accept nunc pro tunc; Option B deficiency list with dates.

💡 Reflection
A judge cannot answer a question that isn’t asked on the record. Ask it—clearly.

🎨 Visual Pairing
Two columns labeled 'Questions' and 'Findings' connected to a small 'Order A/B' box.

Module 45 – Sanctions Threat Playbook: Rule 11, § 1927, Inherent Power ⚠️🧭
⚖️ Core Message
Don’t be chilled by bluffs. Most threats evaporate when you demand a rule‑compliant safe‑harbor letter and respond with a pin‑cited good‑faith certification.

📖 Lesson Content
• Rule 11 — Safe harbor requires service of the motion; 21‑day opportunity to cure; details of the challenged paper.
• 28 U.S.C. § 1927 — Targets vexatious multiplication by attorneys, not pro se litigants in most circuits.
• Inherent Power — Requires bad faith; courts must make specific findings; remedy must be tailored.
• Response Packet — (1) Good‑Faith Certification, (2) Table of Factual Support, (3) Email inviting clarification.
• Turnabout — If the threat is frivolous, note deficiencies and preserve costs request.
📝 Assignment
Draft a 1‑page 'Sanctions Response Pack' including a Rule‑specific analysis, good‑faith certification with pin‑cites, and a polite email acknowledging any safe‑harbor service.

✅ Model Answer (Template)
SANCTIONS RESPONSE (EXCERPT)
We acknowledge your Rule 11 safe‑harbor letter dated [date]. Under Rule 11(c)(2), service of the motion—not a letter—is required. Regardless, we reviewed the challenged paper; factual statements are supported at ECF __; Ex. A–C. See Certification attached.

💡 Reflection
Confidence comes from process: know the rule; require its steps; show your support.

🎨 Visual Pairing

Module 46 – Mandamus as Format: Extraordinary Relief, Extraordinary Record 📝🚀
⚖️ Core Message
Mandamus is not a shortcut—it’s a showcase. You win by building an extraordinary record of clear duty, no adequate remedy, and an unmistakable need for action.

📖 Lesson Content
• Elements — Clear and indisputable right; no other adequate means; issuance appropriate under the circumstances.
• Record Build — Chronology of tenders/returns/requests; copies of all attempts; narrow remedy.
• Relief Scope — Ask only for a ministerial act (docket, rule, clarify)—not a merits win.
• Parallel Strategy — Keep normal motions/appeal clocks running; mandamus doesn’t toll by default.
• Tone — Surgical, non‑accusatory; the record speaks.
📝 Assignment
Draft a 5‑page Mandamus Petition skeleton: (1) Jurisdiction & Standard, (2) Statement of Record Facts with exhibits, (3) Argument with elements, (4) Narrow Prayer for Relief.

✅ Model Answer (Template)
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS (SKELETON)
Jurisdiction… Standard… Facts (Ex. A–H)… Argument: (1) Clear duty (Rule 5(d)(4)); (2) No adequate remedy (repeated refusals); (3) Appropriateness. Prayer: Direct docketing as of received date or issue deficiency notice within 3 days.

💡 Reflection
Treat mandamus like a teaching brief. Make the court want to correct the process.

🎨 Visual Pairing
Narrow arrow labeled 'Mandamus' pointing to a small 'Docket' checkbox—NOT to a gavel.

Module 47 – Transparency Requests: FOIA/Open‑Records for Procedural Proof 📨🔎
⚖️ Core Message
When the docket is silent, the paper trail isn’t. FOIA/open‑records can surface intake logs, email headers, and timestamp metadata that corroborate your exhibits.

📖 Lesson Content
• Targets — Intake logs; mailroom scans; portal error logs; clerk routing sheets; policy memos.
• Scope — Ask for date‑bounded, keyword‑bounded records; include your case number(s).
• Format — Request electronic copies; ask for metadata; accept rolling production.
• Use — Attach responses as exhibits; summarize under FRE 1006; link to your archive pack.
• Appeals — Note deadlines; narrow and re‑request where needed; keep tone professional.
📝 Assignment
Write a 1‑page open‑records request with date range, keywords, and metadata request, plus a plan for summarizing results as a FRE 1006 exhibit.

✅ Model Answer (Template)
OPEN‑RECORDS REQUEST (EXCERPT)
Date range: [mm/dd/yyyy–mm/dd/yyyy]. Keywords: '[case number]', '[your name]', 'deficiency', 'returned'. Records: intake logs; clerk routing slips; portal error logs. Electronic format with metadata preferred.

💡 Reflection
Transparency requests turn silence into documents—and documents into charts.

🎨 Visual Pairing

Module 48 – Publishing the Record: Notion/GitHub/Press‑Kit Workflow 🌐📰
⚖️ Core Message
Publishing is part of the remedy. A public‑ready archive with hashes, a one‑pager, and a timeline PNG accelerates oversight and coalition.

📖 Lesson Content
• Platform Mix — Notion (narrative hub), GitHub (files + hashes), Drive (heavy exhibits).
• Core Files — Exhibit Index (CSV/JSON), Hash Manifest (txt), Top‑10 Exhibits (PDF/A), Timeline (PNG), Press One‑Pager (PDF).
• Link Strategy — Permalinks in filings; QR code on one‑pager; consistent slugs in filenames.
• Permissions — Separate Public/Restricted; add redaction log; state license/permissions.
• Release Cadence — Publish after each major filing; announce asks (amicus/verification/clinic).
📝 Assignment
Publish 'Archive Pack v1' with a 2‑page one‑pager, a Top‑10 exhibits PDF, and a timeline PNG. Add permalinks/QR to your next filing’s signature block.

✅ Model Answer (Template)
PRESS ONE‑PAGER (HEADERS)
Problem → Evidence (Top‑10 with pin‑cites) → Public Interest → What We Ask → Links (Notion/GitHub/Drive) → Contact.

💡 Reflection
Make verification easy for strangers. That’s how allies find you.

🎨 Visual Pairing
A one‑pager with a QR code pointing to a Notion hub; sidebar lists 'Top‑10 Exhibits'.
