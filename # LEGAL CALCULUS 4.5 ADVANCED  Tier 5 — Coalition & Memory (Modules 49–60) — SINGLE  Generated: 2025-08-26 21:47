Module 49 – Coalition Mapping: From Stakeholders to Actions 🗺️🤝
⚖️ Core Message
Coalition isn’t a list of names; it’s a map of who can do what, when. Map interests to asks, evidence to experts, and deadlines to decision‑makers.

📖 Lesson Content
• Stakeholder Types — Clinics, watchdogs, journalists, academics, policymakers, professional orgs, amicus networks.
• Why They Care — Patient safety, transparency, rights, precedent, public funds, ethics.
• Asks Ladder — Verify three exhibits; sign an amicus; publish a timeline; host a workshop; provide a declaration.
• Contact Spine — One owner; last contact; next step; deadline; materials sent.
• Evidence Pairing — Each ask pairs with one proof (hash‑verified exhibit) and one short summary.
📝 Assignment
Draft a 1‑page Coalition Map: columns = Org | Contact | Why They Care | Specific Ask | Proof (Exhibit/Hash) | Status | Next Step | Deadline.

✅ Model Answer (Template)
STAKEHOLDER ROW (EXAMPLE)
Org: [Clinic]
Why: Procedural justice in pro se matters
Ask: Verify three exhibits + consider amicus interest
Proof: Ex. A (FedEx LC0001; SHA‑256 3f2c…), Ex. B, Ex. C
Status/Next: Emailed 09/01; follow‑up 09/05.

💡 Reflection
Coalitions move when the ask is small, specific, and paired with verifiable proof.

• Issue List — Two or three appellate questions with standards of review.
• Record Core — Top‑10 exhibits with pin‑cites; timeline with LC Bates and hashes.

💡 Reflection
Make support simple: the easier it is to draft responsibly, the likelier someone will say yes.

Module 52 – Verification Network: Peer Review & Hash Witnesses 🔗🧾
⚖️ Core Message
Trust scales when verification scales. Recruit 'hash witnesses' who independently confirm exhibit hashes and sign short declarations.

📖 Lesson Content
• Roles — Verifier (computes hash); Witness (signs § 1746 statement of match); Custodian (maintains originals).
• Protocol — Provide original file + expected hash; verifier computes independently; compare; declare.
• Ledger — Public CSV of file name, SHA‑256, witness initials/date; private ledger of contact details.
• Use in Court — Attach two witness declarations to key exhibits; add source ledger cross‑reference.
• Continuity — Rotate witnesses; keep a minimal, verifiable footprint.
📝 Assignment
Create a 'Hash Witness Kit' (instructions + sample declaration + spreadsheet). Recruit two witnesses to validate three exhibits.

✅ Model Answer (Template)
DECLARATION (HASH WITNESS)
I computed SHA‑256 for '2025‑06‑12_FedEx_ExA.pdf' using [tool]. The value '3f2c…' matches the ledger. /s/ [Name] § 1746.

💡 Reflection
When strangers can verify, allies can trust—and judges can rely.

• Follow‑up — Calendared reminders; public status log when appropriate.
📝 Assignment
Draft a 2‑page oversight complaint focusing on a single procedural failure, with three hashed exhibits and a narrow request for action.
