Module 85 – Public Docket Mirrors: Screenshot, Save, Cite 🪞📜
⚖️ Core Message
If the docket is the memory, mirror it. Regularly capture PDFs and screenshots of the docket and key entries so changes are visible and provable.

📖 Lesson Content
• Cadence — Weekly PDF of docket; screenshots on major changes.
• Proof — Timestamp + hash every capture; store in /Public/Docket and /Restricted/Originals.
• Cites — 'Dkt (captured 2025‑09‑01, SHA‑256 3f2c…) at Entry 51'.
• Diffs — Before/after images to show edits, seals, or deletions.
• Court Use — Attach as exhibits in Notices of Docket Change.
📝 Assignment
Create a 'Docket Mirror' folder with the latest PDF, three screenshots, and a short declaration authenticating capture method and hash.

✅ Model Answer (Template)
DECLARATION (Docket Mirror)
I captured the docket on 09/01 at 09:03 using [tool]. The PDF and PNGs' SHA‑256 values are listed in Ex. A.

💡 Reflection
A mirrored docket is a guardrail against accidental memory loss.

Module 86 – Timeline → Brief: Turning Chronology into Argument ⏳➡️📄
⚖️ Core Message
A good appellate section is a cleaned timeline with standards. Move from chronology to headings that map to relief.

📖 Lesson Content
• Three Columns — Date • Event • Cite (ECF/Exhibit/Hash).
• Grouping — Cluster events by issue (service, findings, suppression).
• Bridge — For each cluster, add a rule/standard and the ask.
• Template — Use the timeline as a FRE 1006 exhibit and as the brief's backbone.
• Pin‑Cites — Every sentence gets a cite or moves to argument.
📝 Assignment
Draft a 1‑page timeline and convert it into three issue headings with standards and asks.

✅ Model Answer (Template)
HEADING: Denial without Findings (Abuse of Discretion). Timeline ¶¶ 8–12; ask: vacatur & remand for findings.

Module 87 – Archival Citation Standards: Make Memory Portable 🔗📑
⚖️ Core Message
Public memory breaks if citations do. Use portable citations: exhibit letters, Bates, hashes, and stable URLs (mirrors), in that order.

📖 Lesson Content
• Order — Ex./Bates first; docket second; mirrors last.
• Format — 'Ex. D at LC0012 (SHA‑256 3f2c…)'; link mirrors as convenience.
• Stability — Avoid transient URLs; archive snapshots; note access date.
• Readers — Put a 'How to Verify' box near the first citations.
• Consistency — Enforce one house style across all files.
📝 Assignment
Write a one‑page 'Citation Style' for your archive and apply it to five references in a brief.

✅ Model Answer (Template)
CITATION EXAMPLE
Ex. A at LC0003 (SHA‑256 9ab1…), Dkt. 25‑1 at 3.
