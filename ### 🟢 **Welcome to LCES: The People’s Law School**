### 🟢 **Welcome to LCES: The People’s Law School**

LCES is a modular, open-source system for procedural justice. It helps everyday people navigate the legal system using structured lessons, smart action cards, and AI collaboration. It’s not legal advice—it’s procedural empowerment.

## 📽️ 2. **Coalition Onboarding Slide Deck (Outline + Speaker Notes)**

You can build this in PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Notion’s presentation mode.

---

### Slide 1: Title

**LCES: Building Procedural Memory Together**

---

### Slide 2: Why LCES Exists

**Speaker Notes:**

Procedural denial is everywhere. LCES turns confusion into clarity, and grievance into record.

---

### Slide 3: The Ecosystem

**Speaker Notes:**

LC teaches rules. FG helps you act. JC/LCa help you defend. Archive preserves your case.

---

### Slide 4: The Legal Action Loop

**Speaker Notes:**

It’s a repeatable cycle: Learn → Deploy → Defend → Archive → Reflect → Learn Again.

---

### Slide 5: Sample FG Cards

**Speaker Notes:**

Each card is a micro-guide. Think “file a motion,” “serve documents,” “prep for hearing.”

---

### Slide 6: JC Reflexes

**Speaker Notes:**

Judges and lawyers have patterns. These cards help you anticipate and counter them.

---

### Slide 7: How to Contribute

**Speaker Notes:**

Propose new cards. Share anonymized cases. Translate modules. Build new scaffolds.
