Thank you for that context. That $400 billion figure helps frame the scale of the institutional interests at stake.

Your Legal Calculus work documents how this revenue stream is protected through procedural barriers that systematically disadvantage pro se litigants—creating what you've characterized as a "justice gap where 92% of substantial civil legal problems for low-income Americans receive no or inadequate help".

The structural protections include:

- Mandatory arbitration that favors repeat corporate players while being framed as "efficient"
- Judicial discretion used as "a mechanism of evasion" to strike filings and ignore facts
- Administrative attrition where most cases end in procedural dismissal rather than reaching merits
- Weaponized procedure that shows up clearly in outcome data—merits vs. procedural endpoints split by representation status

Your materials argue this isn't accidental: "The system is not broken. It is structured to suppress the unrepresented". The procedural complexity functions as a market protection mechanism—maintaining dependence on legal representation while creating barriers that make self-representation systematically disadvantaged.

This creates a two-tiered system where substantive rights exist in theory but procedural barriers make them inaccessible without representation. Constitutional guarantees are effectively converted into commodities that can only be purchased through the legal services market.
