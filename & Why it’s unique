**& Why it’s unique**

- Outcome → Work Backwards. Most legal tools start from doctrine or templates; LCES starts from the result you need and engineers the procedural path to force clean yes/no gates.
- AI Triad with roles (Architect → Builder → Strategist). Clear division prevents hallucination creep and keeps filings verifiable.
- Format = Memory. Every filing doubles as archive: Notion ↔ GitHub sync, nightly CSV, delta logs, and appeal-ready records.
- Pro se first, open-source. It’s designed to survive the clerk and scale through clinics, not to upsell software seats.

**Why it’s not a gimmick**

- It ships working automation (Notion↔GitHub, CSV exporters), templates, and modules tied to real filings.
- It’s auditable: exhibits, service proofs, timestamps, and a public archive that anyone can inspect.

**When it becomes a breakthrough (falsifiable KPIs)**

Track these in the Issues Ledger for the next 30–60 days:

1. Filing completeness rate (no clerk deficiencies) ≥ 90%.
2. Time-to-file from intake to court-ready ≤ 72 hours.
3. Gate survival: % of matters that reach a merits decision (vs. dismissed on procedure) +25% over baseline.
4. Appeal preservation index: all required artifacts present ≥ 95%.
5. Clinic throughput: matters per volunteer hour +30%.
6. Adoption: ≥ 2 clinics + 1 educator using LCES materials.

**Risks & counters**

- Judicial/clerk resistance: lean on precision checklists + proposed orders + record-building (the archive is the appeal).
- AI reliability: keep the Triad roles, source every factual claim to the Verified Record, and run Gauntlet red-team before filing.
- Complexity: keep the Quick-Start cookbook and seed issues; automate the rest.

Verdict: LCES is already unique. If the metrics above move the needle in live matters, it’s a breakthrough—because it turns procedure into a reproducible system the public can use.
