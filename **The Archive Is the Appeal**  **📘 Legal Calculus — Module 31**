The Archive Is the Appeal

⚖️ Core Message

When formal review is blocked, the public archive becomes the path to accountability. Build an archive that any appellate clerk, reporter, or clinic can navigate in minutes.
📖 Lesson Content

1. Mirror Core: Docket index, exhibits (Bates + hash), orders, timeline, outreach.
2. Traceability: Every claim ties to a document and a date; every document has a hash.
3. Teaching Mode: Each folder has a README with 'what this proves' in two lines.
4. Continuity: Export PDFs; keep a CHANGELOG; never overwrite—append.
📝 Assignment

Draft a 'Public Archive README' (300 words) that explains structure, verification (hashes), and how to reproduce key facts.
✅ Model Response

PUBLIC ARCHIVE — README (excerpt)

Structure: /Timeline, /Pleadings, /Exhibits (Bates), /Orders, /Notices, /Media, /FOIA.

Verification: Each PDF has a SHA‑256 in Index.md; recompute to confirm integrity.

Reproduction: To verify 'timely mailing,' open Ex. A (USPS) and Dkt 18.
