📘 Legal Calculus 4.5
Tier 2 — Lawfare Resistance
Module 11 – Service Is Jurisdiction 📬🧾
⚖️ Core Message
If service isn’t perfected — and provable — the court may lack power to act on your papers. Service creates obligation, starts clocks, and anchors due process. Prove it in the record.

📖 Lesson Content
• Service as Trigger 🎯 — Proper service (per FRCP 4/5 or state equivalents) creates the court’s power over parties and starts response deadlines.
• Service as Proof 📸 — If you can’t prove service, it didn’t happen. File a Certificate of Service and attach receipts/affidavits (process server, certified mail, delivery logs, stipulated email).
• Service as Strategy 🧠 — Choose the rule‑compliant method that’s fastest and least disputable; get stipulations for email service; update addresses; use waiver where efficient.
📝 Assignment
Draft a Certificate of Service (COS) for your most recent filing. Include: (1) document served; (2) date/time; (3) names/addresses; (4) method with tracking/affidavit; (5) signature. Add an exhibit list for proof of service.

💡 Reflection
Service is the infrastructure of due process. When your record shows clean, verifiable service, you control the clock and close off easy evasions. Appeals begin with a reliable service record.
