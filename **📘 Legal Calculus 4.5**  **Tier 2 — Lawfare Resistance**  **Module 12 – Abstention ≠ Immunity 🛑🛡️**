Tier 2 — Lawfare Resistance
Module 12 – Abstention ≠ Immunity 🛑🛡️
⚖️ Core Message
Abstention doctrines are narrow, not a shield against accountability. Courts defer only in limited circumstances and must not abstain when bad faith, harassment, or an inadequate forum is shown.

📖 Lesson Content
• Younger’s Domain 🎯 — After Sprint, Younger typically applies only to: (1) ongoing criminal prosecutions, (2) certain civil enforcement actions akin to criminal prosecution, and (3) civil proceedings that uniquely further a court’s judicial functions (e.g., contempt).
• Narrow Exceptions 🔥 — Even if a case falls within Younger’s domain, courts should not abstain when there is bad faith or harassment, extraordinary circumstances causing irreparable injury, or no adequate opportunity to present federal claims in the state forum.
• How to Rebut 🧰 — Show Sprint does not apply (no qualifying proceeding, purely private arbitration, or no ongoing state case), or prove an exception. Seek tailored relief (e.g., prospective injunctive relief against officials under Ex parte Young) that does not intrude on a state judgment.
📝 Assignment
Draft an Opposition to Motion to Stay Based on Younger Abstention. Include:
1. Sprint Category Analysis — explain why the proceeding does not fit any Younger category (or is not ongoing/state-driven).
2. Adequate Forum — show you lack a fair opportunity to raise federal claims (procedural blocks, nonjudicial forum, or record‑based denial).
3. Exceptions — tie concrete facts to bad faith/harassment or extraordinary circumstances and ongoing irreparable harm.
4. Requested Relief — deny stay; alternatively, limit scope (allow non‑interfering claims) or expedite ruling.

✅ Model Answer (Example)
PLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO STAY (YOUNGER)

Introduction. Defendant seeks a blanket stay under Younger, but the doctrine is narrow and inapplicable here.

I. Sprint Category Analysis. There is no ongoing state criminal prosecution, no state‑initiated civil enforcement action akin to a prosecution, and no civil proceeding that uniquely furthers a state court’s judicial functions. The related matter is [private arbitration / administrative investigation / closed state case], which does not trigger Younger.

II. Adequate Opportunity. Even if Younger’s domain applied, abstention would be improper because Plaintiff lacks a meaningful opportunity to press federal claims in the state forum. Record facts show [clerk non‑docketing / refusal to accept filings / denial without hearing / forum lacking authority over § 1983].

III. Exceptions — Bad Faith / Extraordinary Circumstances. The state‑side actions are retaliatory and undertaken in bad faith, as shown by [timeline, threats, selective enforcement]. Ongoing irreparable harm exists: [loss of employment, chilled speech, medical license risk], which warrants federal intervention.

IV. Requested Relief. The Motion to Stay should be denied. Alternatively, any abstention should be strictly limited so this Court can adjudicate claims and remedies that will not interfere with any state proceeding. Prospective relief against officials under Ex parte Young remains proper.

💡 Reflection
Abstention is a scalpel, not a sledgehammer. Force the court to do the Sprint analysis on the record and to address exceptions fact‑by‑fact. Precision turns a default stay into a denial or a narrowed order you can live with—and appeal.
