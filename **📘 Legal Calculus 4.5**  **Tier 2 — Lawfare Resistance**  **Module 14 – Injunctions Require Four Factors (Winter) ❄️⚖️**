Tier 2 — Lawfare Resistance
Module 14 – Injunctions Require Four Factors (Winter) ❄️⚖️
⚖️ Core Message
Preliminary injunctions and TROs are extraordinary. You must prove the four Winter factors with facts, not rhetoric: (1) likelihood of success, (2) irreparable harm, (3) balance of equities, and (4) public interest. Tailor the relief to the harm and the record.

📖 Lesson Content
• Likelihood of Success ✅ — Show why you are likely to win on at least one claim. Point to citations, evidence, and clean procedural posture.
• Irreparable Harm 🚑 — Harm must be immediate and not fixable by money (constitutional violations, chilled speech, medical license risk, loss of livelihood). Use declarations and exhibits.
• Balance of Equities ⚖️ — Explain why the hardship to you outweighs any burden on the defendant from pausing their conduct.
• Public Interest 🌍 — Show how an injunction serves the public (law compliance, patient safety, whistleblower protections, constitutional rights).
• Tailoring 🎯 — Ask only for what’s necessary (narrowly drawn orders, sunset dates, status reports). Overbreadth invites denial.
• Circuit Notes 🗺️ — Some circuits recognize a 'serious questions' sliding scale; always check your circuit’s articulation and apply the strictest phrasing.
📝 Assignment
Draft a two‑page Motion for Preliminary Injunction applying the Winter factors. Include: (1) a one‑paragraph factual intro, (2) a section for each factor with record citations, and (3) a narrowly tailored Proposed Order.

✅ Model Answer (Template Excerpt)
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

Introduction. Plaintiff seeks a narrowly tailored preliminary injunction halting enforcement of [policy/action] that is causing ongoing constitutional and professional harm.

I. Likelihood of Success. Plaintiff is likely to prevail on [Claim], because [cite statute/constitutional provision] and record facts (Exs. A–D) show [brief legal theory].

II. Irreparable Harm. Each day of enforcement inflicts non‑compensable injury: [loss of speech rights/medical license risk/retaliation], supported by sworn declaration (Ex. E) and contemporaneous records (Exs. F–G).

III. Balance of Equities. The injunction preserves the status quo and prevents unlawful harm to Plaintiff; Defendant suffers minimal burden from pausing likely unlawful conduct.

IV. Public Interest. Granting relief vindicates federal rights and protects [patients/consumers/public safety] while this case proceeds.

Requested Relief. Plaintiff requests an order enjoining [specific conduct], requiring [limited affirmative step, if any], and setting an expedited briefing and hearing schedule.

Respectfully submitted,
/s/ [Your Name]
Date: [Insert Date]

💡 Reflection
Courts grant injunctions when the record makes the risk of injustice undeniable. Win the factors with evidence, not adjectives; and make the remedy as small as possible to solve the harm.
