📘 Legal Calculus 4.5
Tier 2 — Lawfare Resistance
Module 16 (Revised) – Motions Must State Grounds & Relief with Particularity (FRCP 7(b)) 🧱🖊️
⚖️ Core Message
Courts deny vague requests. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 7(b)(1) requires a written motion that states (1) the specific grounds with record support and (2) the precise relief requested. Particularity turns a plea into a decision‑ready order.

📖 Lesson Content
• Two Parts of Particularity ✌️ — (A) Grounds: cite the rule/statute/case and pin‑cite the record (Exs., ¶¶, ECF Nos.). (B) Relief: draft exactly what the order should say, in numbered ‘IT IS ORDERED’ clauses.
• Decision‑Ready Packet 📦 — Include: Points & Authorities (if required), declaration(s), exhibits, proposed order, certificate of service, and a meet‑and‑confer statement where local rules require it.
• Format to Win 🧭 — Use headings, short paragraphs, bullets, and prejudice/harmlessness analysis. Avoid adjectives; lead with facts. Give the court a narrow, administrable remedy.
• Cure by Leave 🩹 — If you need to supplement, file late, or exceed a limit, seek leave. Show good cause or excusable neglect; attach the proposed filing as Exhibit 1 so the judge can grant and docket in one step.
• Respect Local Rules 📜 — Page limits, font/margins, hearing requests, reply timing, conferral requirements—mirror them in your motion.
✅ One‑Page Checklist
• Caption + Title that matches the relief.
• Issue & Requested Relief — one sentence each, up front.
• Grounds with particularity — rule/case + record pin‑cites.
• Proposed Order — numbered ‘IT IS ORDERED…’ clauses.
• Meet‑and‑Confer statement (if required).
• Certificate of Service + attachments index (Ex. 1–N).

IN THE [COURT NAME]
[Your Name], Plaintiff,
v.
[Defendant], Defendant.
Case No. [___]

PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL REPLY

Issue & Requested Relief. Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 7(b)(1) and [Local Rule X‑Y], Plaintiff moves for leave to file the attached Supplemental Reply (Exhibit 1) limited to addressing [new authority filed on DATE / new fact arising on DATE].

Grounds Stated with Particularity. Good cause exists because: (1) the [new authority/fact] post‑dates Plaintiff’s reply and bears directly on [disputed issue], see Ex. 2 (docket entry / notice); (2) the supplemental material is concise (≤ [X] pages) and confined to that development; and (3) consideration promotes a complete and accurate record for decision.

Prejudice/Harmlessness. No party is prejudiced. Defendant may file a sur‑reply of ≤ [Y] pages within [Z] days if the Court permits.

Proposed Order. A proposed order is submitted contemporaneously.

Meet‑and‑Confer. On [DATE/TIME], undersigned conferred with defense counsel via [email/phone]. Defendant [does not oppose / takes no position / opposes]. See Ex. 3 (email thread).

Respectfully submitted,
/s/ [Your Name]
[Address] | [Phone] | [Email]
Date: [Insert Date]

[PROPOSED] ORDER
IT IS ORDERED that Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Reply is GRANTED.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk shall file Exhibit 1 as Plaintiff’s Supplemental Reply.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendant may file a sur‑reply not to exceed [Y] pages within [Z] days.

💡 Reflection
Write the order first, then back‑fill the grounds with record cites. Particularity shrinks discretion and forces a yes/no decision on a narrow, fair remedy.
