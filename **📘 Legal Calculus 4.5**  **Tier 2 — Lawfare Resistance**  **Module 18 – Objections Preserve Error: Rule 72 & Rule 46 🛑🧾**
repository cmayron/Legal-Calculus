Tier 2 — Lawfare Resistance
Module 18 – Objections Preserve Error: Rule 72 & Rule 46 🛑🧾
⚖️ Core Message
If you don’t object, you often waive it. Timely, specific objections create de novo review (for dispositive R&Rs) and preserve issues for appeal. Without them, courts treat silence as consent.

📖 Lesson Content
• Timing & Targets ⏱️🎯 — File objections within 14 days: to a magistrate judge’s Report & Recommendation under Rule 72(b)(2) / 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), and to non‑dispositive orders under Rule 72(a). Request a short stay if you need transcripts to finalize specifics.
• Specificity & Standard 📏 — Be specific. Cite page/line and ECF/Exhibit pin‑cites. For 72(b): de novo review of the objected portions. For 72(a): the district judge must modify or set aside parts that are clearly erroneous or contrary to law.
• Make the Record 🧾 — Number each objection; tie facts to law; attach key exhibits; and propose the corrected ruling. Failure to object specifically can waive appellate review.

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE [DISTRICT]
[Your Name], Plaintiff,
v.
[Defendant], Defendant.
Case No. [____]

PLAINTIFF’S OBJECTIONS TO MAGISTRATE JUDGE’S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

Introduction & Timeliness. Plaintiff files these objections within 14 days of service of the Report and Recommendation (“R&R”), see Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2) and 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1). Plaintiff objects to the following portions of the R&R.

Standard of Review. The district judge reviews de novo those portions of the R&R to which specific objections are made. Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3).

Objection 1 — [Title]. The R&R errs by [identify error]. Record cites: ECF No. [__] at [page:line]; Ex. A ¶ [__]. Law: [case/rule]. The correct disposition is [state requested correction].

Objection 2 — [Title]. [Explain with pin‑cites and authority].

Objection 3 — [Title]. [Explain with pin‑cites and authority].

Requested Relief. Plaintiff asks the Court to reject the R&R in the respects identified above and enter the attached Proposed Order granting [specific relief], or alternatively to remand the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions.

Respectfully submitted,
/s/ [Your Name]
Date: [Insert Date]

[PROPOSED] ORDER
IT IS ORDERED that Plaintiff’s Objections are SUSTAINED as to [Objections 1–3], the Report and Recommendation is REJECTED in those respects, and [specific relief] is GRANTED.

💡 Reflection
Objections convert silence into review. Treat the 14‑day window as a filing sprint: be precise, tie to the record, and hand up the corrected order you want signed.
