📘 Legal Calculus 4.5
Tier 2 — Lawfare Resistance
Module 19 – Reconsideration ≠ Re‑Argument: Rule 59(e), Rule 54(b) 🧠🔁
⚖️ Core Message
A motion to reconsider is not a second bite. Use it to correct clear error, address new law or new evidence, or prevent manifest injustice — not to re‑argue what was already decided. Pick the right rule and be precise.

📖 Lesson Content
• Which Rule? 🧭 — Use Rule 59(e) to alter or amend a **final judgment** (within 28 days). Use Rule 54(b) (and any local rule) to reconsider **interlocutory** orders before final judgment.
• Proper Grounds 🎯 — (1) Clear error of law or fact; (2) Newly discovered evidence (despite diligence); (3) Intervening change in controlling law; (4) To prevent manifest injustice.
• What It’s Not 🚫 — Not for arguments or evidence that could have been raised before; not a chance to expand the brief. Keep it tight and targeted.
• Appellate Clock ⏱️ — A timely Rule 59(e) motion tolls the time to appeal. Interlocutory reconsideration typically does not. Know your deadlines.
• Format & Proof 📑 — Attach the new authority/evidence, explain diligence, and propose a corrected order. Observe local page limits and certification requirements.
📝 Assignment
Draft a **Motion to Reconsider** that:
1) Identifies whether Rule 59(e) (final) or Rule 54(b)/local rule (interlocutory) applies;
2) States one proper ground (clear error, new evidence, or intervening law) with pin‑cites;
3) Explains diligence (for new evidence) or the precise legal error;
4) Attaches the evidence/authority; and
5) Includes a short Proposed Order.

✅ Model Answer (Template Excerpt)
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO RECONSIDER

Plaintiff moves under Fed. R. Civ. P. [59(e) / 54(b)] and Local Rule [X‑Y] to reconsider the Court’s [Order/Judgment] (ECF No. __) entered on [date].

Ground & Standard. Reconsideration is warranted to correct **clear error** of law and prevent manifest injustice. The Order misapplied [controlling authority] by [briefly state error] (ECF No. __ at __:__). See [case, pin‑cite].

Argument. The record shows [two‑to‑three pinpoint facts with cites] that the Court did not address. Correcting this error changes the outcome on [issue].

Alternatively — Newly Discovered Evidence. Since the ruling, Plaintiff obtained [Ex. A], which could not have been discovered with reasonable diligence because [explain]. This evidence is material and would likely alter the result. See [authority].

Requested Relief. Plaintiff respectfully asks the Court to vacate the portion of the [Order/Judgment] at pages [__] and enter the attached Proposed Order granting [specific relief].

Respectfully submitted,
/s/ [Your Name]
Date: [Insert Date]

[PROPOSED] ORDER
IT IS ORDERED that Plaintiff’s Motion to Reconsider is GRANTED for the reasons stated. The Court VACATES [portion of prior order] and ORDERS [specific relief].

💡 Reflection
Reconsideration should sharpen — not lengthen — the record. One clean ground, a short correction, and a signable order are more persuasive than a sprawling re‑brief.
