Module 20 – Rule 60(b) Relief from Judgment: Extraordinary, Targeted Fix 🧩⚖️
⚖️ Core Message
Rule 60(b) is not a second appeal. It is an extraordinary, narrowly tailored remedy to relieve a party from a final judgment or order when specific grounds exist and equity demands it.

📖 Lesson Content
• Which Provision & When ⏱️ — Rule 60(a) fixes clerical mistakes; Rule 60(b)(1)–(6) addresses mistake/excusable neglect, newly discovered evidence, fraud/misconduct, void judgments, satisfaction, or 'any other reason.' Motions must be made within a reasonable time; for (1)–(3), no later than 1 year after entry.
• Not a Re‑Brief 🚫 — 60(b) is not for arguments or evidence that could have been raised earlier. Show diligence and why ordinary appeal or Rule 59(e) was inadequate.
• What You Must Show 📌 — Identify the subsection; establish timeliness; attach proof (declarations, exhibits); and, where applicable, show a meritorious claim/defense and lack of undue prejudice.
• Strategy & Posture 🧭 — Use 60(a) for true clerical errors; 59(e) (within 28 days) to alter/amend final judgment; 60(b) for exceptional circumstances. A timely 59(e) tolls appeal time; a 60(b) generally does not (except as provided by FRAP 4(a)(4)(A)(vi) for certain timely 60 motions).
• State Analogs ⚖️ — Most states mirror Rule 60. Cite the state rule if you’re in state court, but the principles travel.
