Module 21 – Notice of Appeal & the Clock: FRAP 3–4 ⏰📤
⚖️ Core Message
Appeals are won or lost on deadlines. File a clean, timely Notice of Appeal and know exactly what tolls the clock. FRAP 3 sets what a notice must contain; FRAP 4 sets when it must be filed—and when that time is paused.

📖 Lesson Content
• Civil Deadlines ⏱️ — File within 30 days of entry of judgment; 60 days if the United States, a U.S. agency, or U.S. officer is a party (FRAP 4(a)(1)(A)–(B)).
• Tolling Motions 🛑 — These pause the appeal clock if timely: Rule 50(b) (renewed JMOL); Rule 52(b) (amended/additional findings); Rule 59 (new trial or alter/amend); and Rule 60 (if filed no later than 28 days after judgment) (FRAP 4(a)(4)(A)).
• Cross‑Appeal ⤴️ — After the first notice is filed, other parties have 14 days (or the remainder of the original time, whichever is longer) to cross‑appeal (FRAP 4(a)(3)).
• Premature Notices 🍼 — A notice filed after announcement but before entry is treated as filed on the date of entry (FRAP 4(a)(2)); if tolling motions are pending, a notice filed before they’re resolved becomes effective when the last such motion is decided (FRAP 4(a)(4)(B)).
• What the Notice Must Say 🧾 — Identify the party(ies) taking the appeal, the judgment/order being appealed, and the court appealed to; then sign and serve (FRAP 3(c)).
• Perfecting the Appeal 🎯 — Pay fees; order transcripts or file a certificate stating none are needed (FRAP 10(b)); monitor docketing by the court of appeals; some circuits require an appellate docketing statement—check local rules.
• Attorney’s Fees ⚖️ — A fees motion generally does not toll the appeal time unless the district court extends the time under Rule 58; check local rules before relying on it.

The checklist should: (1) list any timely tolling motions and their status; (2) show your exact deadline (30/60 days) in calendar terms; (3) confirm transcript orders or a no‑transcript statement; and (4) list any required appellate forms/fees.
