Module 23 – The Record on Appeal: FRAP 10–11 & the Appendix 🎞️📚
⚖️ Core Message
Appellate judges read the record, not your memory. Build and lock the record: designate what the court will see, order the right transcripts, and assemble an appendix/excerpts that put the error in plain view.

📖 Lesson Content
• What the Record Is 📦 — FRAP 10(a): the original papers and exhibits filed in the district court, the transcript of proceedings, and the docket entries.
• Transcripts 🎧 — FRAP 10(b): order necessary parts within the time set by rule (often 14 days after the Notice of Appeal). If ordering less than the whole transcript, file a Statement of the Issues to be raised so the appellee can add needed portions.
• No Transcript? Make One 📝 — FRAP 10(c): prepare a statement of the evidence or proceedings from the best available means; serve it, and have it settled and approved by the district court.
• Agreed Statement 🤝 — FRAP 10(d): the parties may prepare an agreed statement as the record on appeal instead of the full record.
• Correcting Omissions 🧩 — FRAP 10(e): correct or supplement the record by stipulation, by the district court, or by the court of appeals to ensure accuracy.
• Forwarding the Record 🚚 — FRAP 11: the district clerk forwards the record; you still must monitor completeness and move promptly to fix gaps.
• Appendix/Excerpts 📚 — FRAP 30 (and local rules): assemble a focused Appendix/Excerpts of Record with a detailed index, relevant orders, key filings, and pinpointed exhibits—avoid volume without purpose.
📝 Assignment
Create your appellate record kit:
1) **Transcript Order & Statement Regarding Issues** — identify all proceedings needed; if partial, include a short Statement of Issues.
2) **Designation of Appendix/Excerpts** — a one‑page table of contents listing every document, date, and ECF number you’ll include.
3) **(Optional) Motion to Correct/Supplement Record** — if an exhibit or docket item is missing or misdescribed, draft a short motion under FRAP 10(e).

✅ Model Answer (Templates)
TEMPLATE A — TRANSCRIPT ORDER & STATEMENT REGARDING ISSUES

Plaintiff hereby orders the following transcripts under FRAP 10(b):
• [DATE] — Motion Hearing on [topic]
• [DATE] — TRO/PI Hearing
• [DATE] — Final Pretrial/Trial Day [#]
Court Reporter: [Name/Contact]. Payment arranged per reporter instructions.

Statement of Issues (if partial transcript):
1. Whether the Court erred in [issue], given [order cite, ECF __].
2. Whether exclusion of [Exhibit X] was an abuse of discretion (ECF __ at __).

TEMPLATE B — DESIGNATION OF APPENDIX/EXCERPTS (Table of Contents)

A1   Judgment (ECF 120) — 6/15/2025
A2   Order Denying PI (ECF 78) — 03/01/2025
A3   Complaint (ECF 1) — 07/21/2024
A4   TRO Motion & Exhibits A–D (ECF 25‑25-4) — 08/10/2024
A5   Hearing Transcript — 02/28/2025 (ordered)
A6   Plaintiff’s Objections (ECF 91) — 03/15/2025
A7   Notice of Appeal (ECF 121) — 06/20/2025

TEMPLATE C — MOTION TO CORRECT/SUPPLEMENT RECORD (FRAP 10(e))

Plaintiff moves to supplement the record with Exhibit D (FedEx receipt, 06/12/2025), inadvertently omitted from ECF 25. FRAP 10(e) permits correction of omissions to ensure the record accurately reflects what occurred in the district court. The exhibit is attached and was referenced at ECF 25‑3 at 2. Plaintiff respectfully requests an order directing the district clerk to add Exhibit D to the record.

💡 Reflection
Appeals are about the **record you built**. If the decisive page, line, or exhibit isn’t there, the error disappears. Designate with intention, and fix gaps before briefing begins.
