Module 25 – Make It Sworn: Declarations, Affidavits & 28 U.S.C. § 1746 ✍️🧾
⚖️ Core Message
Facts move courts only when they’re admissible. A clean, sworn declaration under 28 U.S.C. § 1746 (or a notarized affidavit) turns experience into evidence: personal knowledge, numbered statements, exhibits authenticated, and a proper perjury clause.

📖 Lesson Content
• Declaration vs. Affidavit 📃 — An affidavit is notarized; a declaration uses the § 1746 perjury statement and usually does not require notarization in federal court. Check state rules for affidavits/notary requirements.
• Required Elements ✅ — Caption & title; declarant identity and personal knowledge; numbered paragraphs; facts (not argument); exhibit references; signature, name printed, date, and the § 1746 sentence.
• § 1746 Language 🗣️ — In the U.S.: “I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.” If outside the U.S.: add “Executed outside the United States.” Include execution date and location.
• Foundation & Authentication 🧱 — Say how you know: “I am custodian/I received this email/I was present.” Attach exhibits with labels (Ex. A, Ex. B) and describe them in-text. Fed. R. Evid. 901, 803(6) (business records).
• Hearsay & Personal Knowledge 👂 — Stick to what you saw, did, or received. Quote short portions and attach the document. Identify who said what, when, and how you know.
• Use Cases 🎯 — Support TRO/PI, summary judgment, motions to compel, objections, sanctions, and to create an appeal-proof factual record when hearings are limited or not recorded.
