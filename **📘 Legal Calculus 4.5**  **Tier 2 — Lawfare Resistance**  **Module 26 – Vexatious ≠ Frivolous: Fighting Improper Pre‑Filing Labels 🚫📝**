Tier 2 — Lawfare Resistance
Module 26 – Vexatious ≠ Frivolous: Fighting Improper Pre‑Filing Labels 🚫📝
⚖️ Core Message
High volume or persistence is not the same as vexatiousness. Courts may restrict access only after notice, a chance to be heard, specific findings that filings are frivolous or harassing, and entry of a narrowly tailored order. Format your opposition to force that analysis.

📖 Lesson Content
• Vexatious ≠ Frivolous 🧭 — 'Vexatious' is a pattern of filings intended to harass or that are overwhelmingly meritless. A single loss, aggressive litigation, or many filings does not equal vexatious conduct.
• Due Process First 🔔 — You are entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard before any pre‑filing restriction or 'vexatious' designation is imposed.
• Required Findings 🧾 — The court must make **substantive findings** of frivolousness/harassment on the **record**—not just conclusions or adjectives.
• Narrow Tailoring ✂️ — Any order must be limited in **scope, subject matter, parties, and time**, leave room for legitimate filings, and consider **less drastic alternatives**.
• Common Tests (Know Your Circuit) 🧪 — Examples:
 • Ninth Circuit (De Long): (1) notice/opportunity; (2) adequate record; (3) substantive findings; (4) narrow tailoring.
 • Second Circuit (Safir): factors include litigation history, motive, representation status, burden on courts/parties, and adequacy of other sanctions.
• Strategic Record 📚 — Compile your docket history, victories or colorable claims, corrections after clerk feedback, and opponent behavior. Attach an **Exhibit Index** with ECF numbers, dates, and outcomes.
• Offer Alternatives 🤝 — Propose targeted remedies short of a blanket ban: page limits, certification under Rule 11, meet‑and‑confer, leave‑to‑file for a limited topic, or a short sunset period.
📝 Assignment
Draft an **Opposition to Motion for Vexatious‑Litigant Designation** (or a **Motion to Vacate/Narrow Pre‑Filing Order**) that:
1) Demands due‑process protections (notice + hearing) and cites your circuit’s test;
2) Shows your filing history with outcomes and colorable claims (table/exhibit index);
3) Attacks any improper findings as conclusory and not supported by the record;
4) Proposes concrete, **narrow** alternatives (scope, parties, time‑limit, leave‑of‑court criteria).

✅ Model Answer (Two Templates)
TEMPLATE A — OPPOSITION TO VEXATIOUS‑LITIGANT DESIGNATION

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE [DISTRICT]
[Your Name], Plaintiff,
v.
[Defendant], Defendant.  Case No. [____]

PLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR VEXATIOUS‑LITIGANT DESIGNATION

Introduction. Access to courts may be limited only after **notice and an opportunity to be heard**, an **adequate record**, **substantive findings** of frivolous/harassing filings, and a **narrowly tailored** remedy (see circuit factors, e.g., De Long / Safir). The Motion fails each requirement.

I. No Substantive Findings Supported by the Record. The Motion cites volume, not frivolousness. The attached Exhibit Index shows [wins/denials without prejudice/appealable issues] and corrections after clerk feedback. Volume ≠ vexatious.

II. Inadequate Record & Conclusory Assertions. The movant omits key filings and outcomes. Courts require a record of cases and filings demonstrating the alleged pattern—not selected anecdotes.

III. Narrow Tailoring & Less Drastic Alternatives. Even if restrictions were considered, any order must be limited in scope, parties, and time, and consider alternatives: certification under Rule 11, page limits, or topic‑limited leave to file.

Requested Relief. Deny the Motion. Alternatively, adopt at most a time‑limited leave‑to‑file procedure limited to [topic/party], with a sunset of [6–12] months and clear criteria for leave.

Respectfully submitted,   /s/ [Your Name]   Date: [Insert Date]

TEMPLATE B — MOTION TO VACATE OR NARROW PRE‑FILING ORDER

Relief Requested. Vacate, or narrowly tailor, the pre‑filing order to [specific subject] and limit it to [time period], because (1) no substantive findings were made; (2) the record is inadequate; and (3) less‑drastic alternatives were not considered. Alternatively, adopt a simple leave‑to‑file screen with objective criteria.

💡 Reflection
The 'pro se double bind': you’re told to keep trying, then punished for trying too much. The way out is **format + factors**—force the court to make on‑record findings and tailor any remedy to actual misconduct, not to your persistence.
