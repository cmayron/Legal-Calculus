Module 28 – Clerk Algorithms of Suppression — Build the Counter‑Record 🗄️🧠
⚖️ Core Message
Suppression is often procedural, not dramatic: mislabels, returns, silent non‑docketing, and 'deficiency' loops. Treat each as data. Build a counter‑record that proves tender, receipt, and rule‑compliant cure—then move for a docket order.

📖 Lesson Content
• Common Patterns 🔁 — Non‑docketed 'returns'; re‑naming filings to bury them; mis‑routing to the wrong case type; issuance delays; 'deficiency' refusals with no cited rule; missing file‑stamp or received date; portal outages with no alternate path.
• Proof of Tender 📬 — Always preserve: mailing receipts, carrier tracking, clerk emails, portal confirmations, time‑stamped screenshots, and in‑person stamps. Convert each into an exhibit the court can read.
• Pin the Rule 📌 — Quote the controlling rule: FRCP 5(d)(4) (clerk must not refuse a filing for improper form), FRCP 79(a) (civil docket), local e‑filing rules, and any administrative orders providing alternate submission methods.
• Ask for Binary Action 🎯 — 'Docket as of received date or issue a deficiency identifying the exact curable defect and the rule.' Never argue by phone—file the ask with exhibits.
• Escalation Ladder 🪜 — (1) Notice of Clerk Communication; (2) Notice of Constructive Denial; (3) Motion to Direct Docketing / to Clarify Docket; (4) Motion to Accept Corrected Filing nunc pro tunc; (5) Mandamus (extraordinary—only if record shows persistent refusal without basis).
• Index Everything 🧾 — Keep a running 'Suppression Index' with columns: Date, Event, Actor, Exact Words, Proof (Exhibit), Rule, Requested Cure, Outcome.
📝 Assignment
Create a two‑part **Counter‑Record Kit**:
1) **Suppression Index (1 page)** — table listing each event with proof and the rule that governs it.
2) **Motion to Direct Docketing or Clarify Docket (3–4 pages)** — attach exhibits of tender/receipt; cite FRCP 5(d)(4), 79(a), and local rules; request docketing as of the received date or a deficiency order specifying the curable defect, plus a short proposed order.

✅ Model Answer (Templates)
TEMPLATE A — NOTICE OF CLERK COMMUNICATION & PRESERVATION OF RECEIVED DATE

Plaintiff files this Notice attaching the Clerk’s [email/return slip] dated [DATE] stating '[quote]'. Exhibits A–C establish tender and receipt on [DATE]. Plaintiff requests that any future docket entry reflect the **received date** of [DATE].

TEMPLATE B — MOTION TO DIRECT DOCKETING OR ISSUE DEFICIENCY ORDER

Relief Requested. An order directing the Clerk to docket the attached filing as of [received date], or, in the alternative, to issue a deficiency order identifying the exact curable defect with a rule citation.

Grounds & Record. Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(d)(4), the clerk must not refuse to file a paper solely because it is not in the form prescribed by these rules. FRCP 79(a) requires a civil docket entry for each paper. Exhibits A–D show timely tender (carrier tracking, portal receipts, and email). Local Rule [X‑Y] provides alternate submission when the portal is unavailable.

Proposed Order. Submitted contemporaneously.

TEMPLATE C — PROPOSED ORDER (DOCKET CORRECTION)

IT IS ORDERED that the Clerk shall docket Plaintiff’s [title] as of [received date] based on the proof attached. Alternatively, within 3 days the Clerk shall issue a deficiency notice identifying the curable defect with citation to the governing rule.

💡 Reflection
When suppression is algorithmic, your answer is algorithmic too: proof + rule + binary request + proposed order. You are building the record that an appellate panel—and a supervising judge—can act on.
