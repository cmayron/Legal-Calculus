Module 33 – Non‑Adversarial Format: Write So They Can Say “Yes” 🤝✅
⚖️ Core Message
You can fight the system without writing like a fight. Non‑adversarial format lowers decision‑cost: neutral tone, precise asks, narrow alternatives, and a signable order. Make it easy for the clerk, opponent, and judge to say “yes.”

📖 Lesson Content
• Start With the Order 🧾 — Draft a short proposed order with <1 page of numbered relief. Offer **Option A (primary)** and **Option B (narrow fallback)**.
• Frame Small, Grantable Asks 🎯 — Break the request into discrete items (“accept corrected index,” “set 10‑minute status call,” “permit 3‑page sur‑reply”).
• Neutral, Verifiable Tone 🕊️ — Facts in declarations, law in the brief, no accusations. Quote exactly, attach proof, and avoid adjectives.
• Decision Map 🗺️ — Include a one‑page cover: Issue → Rule/Authority → Record pin‑cites → Requested action. Put ECF numbers in the margin or a small table.
• Meet‑and‑Confer First ☎️ — Document efforts; attach a short certification. Invite a stipulation and attach an editable proposed order.
• Compliance & Convenience 🧩 — State local‑rule compliance (page limits, font, conferral). Provide PDF/A with OCR, bookmarks, exhibit index, and certificate of service.
• Default “Yes” Language 🔁 — Add: “Alternatively, Plaintiff will file a corrected (shorter/cleaner) version within 3 days if the Court prefers.”
📝 Assignment
Take a paragraph that reads like a fight (e.g., “the clerk wrongfully rejected…”) and rewrite it into a **Non‑Adversarial Motion Pack**:
1) One‑page Decision Cover (Issue → Authority → Record → Ask)
2) 2–3 page Motion with neutral facts + rule pin‑cites
3) Meet‑and‑Confer Certification (dates, attempts, result)
4) Proposed Order with Option A / Option B
5) Certificate of Service

✅ Model Answer (Templates)
TEMPLATE A — STIPULATION & [PROPOSED] ORDER (SHORT EXTENSION)

Stipulation. The parties stipulate under Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b)(1)(A) to extend Plaintiff’s response deadline to [DATE]. Good cause: counsel’s availability and ongoing meet‑and‑confer regarding narrowing issues. No prior extensions on this deadline.

[PROPOSED] ORDER
Option A: The deadline is extended to [DATE].
Option B: The deadline is extended to [DATE‑X days]; Plaintiff may file a 3‑page sur‑reply by [DATE].

TEMPLATE B — MOTION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE RELIEF (FORMAT‑NEUTRAL)

Relief Requested. Entry of the attached order (A/B) to resolve a minor, time‑sensitive procedural matter.
Grounds. Good cause under Rule 6(b) and the Court’s inherent authority to manage docket. Record cites: ECF __ (prior order); Ex. A (email); Ex. B (receipt).
Certification. Movant conferred with opposing counsel on [dates]; [no opposition / opposition / no response]. See Decl. ¶¶ 3–4.

TEMPLATE C — DECISION COVER (ONE PAGE)

Issue → “Accept corrected exhibit index, or set 3‑day cure.”
Authority → FRCP 5(d)(4), 6(b), Local Rule [X‑Y].
Record → ECF 25 (filing), Ex. A (return email), Ex. B (receipt).
Ask → Order Option A (accept nunc pro tunc) / Option B (3‑day cure with deficiency list).

💡 Reflection
Non‑adversarial writing isn’t surrender; it’s strategy. Reduce friction, increase clarity, and hand the Court an easy path to a fair result.
