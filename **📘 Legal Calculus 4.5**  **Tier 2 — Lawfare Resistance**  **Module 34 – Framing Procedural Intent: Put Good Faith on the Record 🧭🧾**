Tier 2 — Lawfare Resistance
Module 34 – Framing Procedural Intent: Put Good Faith on the Record 🧭🧾
⚖️ Core Message
Courts read motive into format. If you don’t frame your procedural intent, opponents will. State your purpose, narrow your ask, and certify good faith—up front. A short 'Procedural Intent & Good‑Faith Statement' reduces friction and preempts 'vexatious' narratives.

📖 Lesson Content
• Say Why Now ⏱️ — Open with a one‑paragraph timeline: what event triggered this filing and what deadline or harm you face. Explain diligence (attempts to confer, prior cures).
• Say Why Here 🧭 — One sentence on jurisdiction/venue/authority (e.g., Rule 7(b), Rule 6(b), Rule 62/FRAP 8). Anchor the court’s power to grant the narrow relief requested.
• Say What You Want 🎯 — The narrow, signable order (Option A / Option B). State that the request is limited and time‑boxed.
• Say What You Tried 🤝 — Meet‑and‑confer efforts with dates and outcomes. Attach a short certification and the email thread as an exhibit.
• Say What You’re Not Doing 🚫 — One line: “This motion is not for delay or harassment; it is to preserve rights and enable a merits decision.” Cite Rule 1 (just, speedy, inexpensive) and Rule 11(b) certification.
• Format It the Same Way Every Time 🧱 — Insert a labeled block after the caption: **Procedural Intent & Good‑Faith Statement**; then your Decision Cover (Issue → Authority → Record → Ask). Consistency builds credibility.
📝 Assignment
Add a **Procedural Intent & Good‑Faith Statement** to one of your current motions. Then prepare:
1) a one‑page Decision Cover (Issue → Authority → Record → Ask), and
2) a Meet‑and‑Confer Certification with dates, who you contacted, and results.
Finally, add a one‑line 'Not for Delay/Harassment' disclaimer in your Introduction.

💡 Reflection
Intent is evidence when it’s formatted. By stating purpose, narrowing the ask, and certifying good faith, you reduce judicial risk‑aversion and turn 'why are you filing this?' into 'why wouldn’t we grant this?'
