The Order You Want — Draft It

⚖️ Core Message

Judges rule faster when you hand them the words. A crisp proposed order makes your relief easy to sign.
📖 Lesson Content

1. Always attach a short, standalone Proposed Order with every motion that seeks relief.
2. Use neutral language; frame findings briefly and the relief precisely.
3. Include alternative relief ("in the alternative") and a blank date/signature line.
4. File the order as a separate attachment per local rules.
📝 Assignment

Draft a 1‑page Proposed Order granting preliminary injunctive relief or, in the alternative, setting an expedited hearing schedule.
