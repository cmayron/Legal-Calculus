Protective Orders & Redactions — Seal vs. Access

⚖️ Core Message

Protect what must be private without hiding what the public needs.
📖 Lesson Content

1. Identify the narrow interest for sealing (PII, medical, trade secret).
2. Use targeted redactions; file a public redacted version and a sealed unredacted.
3. Propose a two‑tier protective order (confidential/attorney’s eyes only).
4. Justify sealing with specific facts; avoid conclusory labels.
📝 Assignment

Draft a 'Motion to Seal with Redacted Public Filing' including a short declaration identifying specific harm from disclosure.
✅ Model Response

MOTION TO SEAL WITH REDACTED PUBLIC FILING (excerpt)

1. Plaintiff seeks targeted redactions of patient identifiers (Ex. A).

2. A public redacted version is filed concurrently; the unredacted is lodged under seal.

3. Specific harm: risk of re‑identification and statutory privacy obligations.

 

💡 Reflection Summary

Seal narrowly; publish the rest.
