Sanctions & Safe Harbor — Proportional Response

⚖️ Core Message

When misconduct occurs, document, confer, and calibrate the remedy.
📖 Lesson Content

1. Preserve with a short notice and exhibits; keep tone factual.
2. Serve draft motions when rules require safe harbor; calendar the period.
3. Seek tailored remedies: fees, re‑production, or evidentiary limits.
4. Avoid overreach; courts punish excess.
📝 Assignment

Draft a 'Notice of Discovery Misconduct and Intent to Seek Fees' with three bullet facts and a proposed cure.
✅ Model Response

NOTICE (excerpt)

• Defendants withheld emails responsive to RFP 3 (see Ex. A).

• After conferral on Aug. 10, production remained incomplete.

• Plaintiff will seek fees unless complete production occurs within 7 days.

 

💡 Reflection Summary

Proportional requests are granted; overreaching is punished.
🎨 Visual Concept

A balanced scale with a modest fee tag, not a sledgehammer.
