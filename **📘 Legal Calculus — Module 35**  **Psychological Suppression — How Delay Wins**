Psychological Suppression — How Delay Wins

⚖️ Core Message

Delay is strategy. Recognize it, measure it, and convert it into evidence.
📖 Lesson Content

1. Identify Tactics: Late service, minute entries without orders, serial extensions.
2. Metrics: Days pending per motion; timeline with color bands for silence.
3. Countermoves: Notices of inaction; requests for findings; narrow hearings.
4. Resilience: Pre‑schedule your next filing; treat each delay as data.
