Discretion as Cover — When Integrity Becomes Immunity

⚖️ Core Message

Discretion must be tethered to standards and findings. Demand reasons or preserve the absence.
📖 Lesson Content

1. Spotting Cover: 'Judicial economy' with no factors; 'case management' with no record cites.
2. Requests: Ask for factor‑tied findings or a statement of what wasn’t reached.
3. Preservation: File 'Request for Specific Findings' or a notice documenting silence.
4. Appellate Use: Lack of findings is itself reviewable in many regimes.
📝 Assignment

Draft a one‑page 'Request for Specific Findings' referencing the rule/factors and the record exhibits by page.
✅ Model Response

REQUEST FOR SPECIFIC FINDINGS (excerpt)
