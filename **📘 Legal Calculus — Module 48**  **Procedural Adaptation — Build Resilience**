Procedural Adaptation — Build Resilience

⚖️ Core Message

Adapt procedure to obstacles: split relief, sequence asks, and close loops fast.
📖 Lesson Content

1. Split Relief: emergency (narrow now) vs. broader (later).
2. Sequence: path if denied (findings → certification → appeal).
3. Close Loops: notices documenting each step; updated timeline.
4. Templates: keep leave/motion/notice templates ready.
📝 Assignment

Create a two‑path flow (Relief Now vs. Relief Later) with the notices/orders you’ll file at each step.
✅ Model Response

FLOW (excerpt)

Now: Notice → 20‑min hearing → short order.

Later: Certification → appeal notice → archive update.

 

💡 Reflection Summary

Resilience is procedural, not just emotional.
🎨 Visual Concept

Two parallel tracks labeled 'Now' and 'Later' converging on 'Record'.
