Abstention Doctrines — The Bad-Faith Exception

⚖️ Core Message

Abstention is not automatic. If state proceedings are leveraged in bad faith, build the exception.
📖 Lesson Content

1. Map the test (Younger/Sprint): identify ongoing proceeding, important state interest, adequacy of forum.
2. Bad Faith Path: show retaliatory motive, harassment, or inability to raise federal claims.
3. Record It: declarations, timeline, and exhibits linking motive to action.
4. Ask Narrowly: seek carve-outs or tailored relief if wholesale abstention looms.
📝 Assignment

✅ Model Response

SUPPLEMENT (excerpt)

1. State action commenced after protected speech; sanctions threatened (Ex. A).
