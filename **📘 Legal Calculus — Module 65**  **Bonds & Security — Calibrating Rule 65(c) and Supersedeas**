Bonds & Security — Calibrating Rule 65(c) and Supersedeas

⚖️ Core Message

Money shouldn’t price out justice. Calibrate bonds with evidence and alternatives.
📖 Lesson Content

1. Request reduction/waiver with detailed cost declarations and narrow relief.
2. Offer non-monetary security (escrow, reporting) when appropriate.
3. Tie bond to actual risk, not rhetoric; propose staged amounts.
4. If denied, preserve the reasons; ask for short findings.
📝 Assignment

Draft a 1-page 'Bond Proposal and Alternative Security' with a cost table and a proposed amount.
✅ Model Response
