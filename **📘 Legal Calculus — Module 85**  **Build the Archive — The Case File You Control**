📘 Legal Calculus — Module 85

Build the Archive — The Case File You Control

⚖️ Core Message

Don’t let the court’s memory be the only memory. A parallel archive makes suppression visible and teaches others how to follow the record.

📖 Lesson Content

1. Purpose — Preserve truth beyond the clerk’s gate; enable teaching, audit, and appeal.

2. Structure — Root folders for Pleadings, Exhibits (Bates), Orders, Timeline, Outreach, Media, FOIA.

3. Public vs. Private — Public (read-only) mirror + private working set; redact PII.

4. Versioning — Date-stamp filenames; keep a CHANGELOG; export PDFs for permanence.

📝 Assignment

💡 Reflection Summary

A parallel archive is due process for the public. It prevents truth from being erased.

🎨 Visual Concept

Two file cabinets: 'Court Docket' and 'Public Archive'. The second glows.
