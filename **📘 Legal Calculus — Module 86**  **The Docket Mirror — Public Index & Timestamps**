The Docket Mirror — Public Index & Timestamps

⚖️ Core Message

A clean, public index lets anyone reconstruct the case and see suppression patterns at a glance.

1. Fields — Date, Docket #, Title, Link, Status, Notes, Public Copy (yes/no).

2. Proof — Include SHA‑256 hash for public PDFs to prove integrity.

3. Updates — Post new entries within 24 hours of filing or receipt.

4. Access — Mirror to Notion/Substack/GitHub Pages; keep an 'Index.md' at root.

📝 Assignment

Create Index.md with 5 sample entries and hashes; export two filings as PDF and compute SHA‑256 to include in the index.
