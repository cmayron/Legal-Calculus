Public Records & FOIA — Evidence the Court Forgot

⚖️ Core Message

When the docket goes quiet, pull records. FOIA and state PRAs can fill gaps and corroborate timelines.

📖 Lesson Content

1. Scope — Identify agencies holding emails, call logs, docket metadata.

2. Specificity — Date ranges, custodians, and keywords reduce delay.

3. Appeals — Calendar statutory deadlines; escalate non‑responses.

4. Publication — Post requests and responses in the archive with hashes.

📝 Assignment

Draft a targeted public records request for clerk communications regarding docket delays between two dates, including custodians and keywords.

✅ Model Response

Public Records Request (excerpt):

Dates: 2025-07-20 to 2025-08-05

Keywords: 'TRO', 'timely docket', 'mail delay', 'Mayron'

Records: Email headers + bodies; call logs; internal memos

 

💡 Reflection Summary

Records law is discovery for the public. Use it when the courtroom door narrows.
