Module 15 – TROs Require Notice or Certification (FRCP 65(b)) 🛎️📑
⚖️ Core Message
Temporary Restraining Orders are extraordinary and short‑lived. Unless you give notice, FRCP 65(b) requires a written certification detailing your efforts to give notice and why notice should not be required. Missing this certification (or notice) can sink the TRO.

📖 Lesson Content
• Notice vs. Ex Parte 📣 — With notice: proceed under 65(a)/(b) and set a prompt hearing. Without notice (ex parte): you must submit specific facts showing immediate, irreparable injury and a written certification of efforts to give notice and why it should not be required.
• Specificity & Duration ⏱️ — A TRO must state its terms specifically, describe the restrained acts, and generally expires after 14 days unless extended for good cause or by consent; the court should set a PI hearing at the earliest time.
• Security/Bond 💳 — Rule 65(c) typically requires security in an amount the court considers proper. Explain why a minimal bond (or none) is appropriate if applicable (public interest, indigency, or equitable factors).
• Local Rules & Format 🧾 — Follow local rules (caption, memorandum of law, proposed order, exhibits, and certificate of service). Attach declarations, key exhibits, and a narrowly tailored proposed order.
📝 Assignment
Assemble a TRO package:
1) Motion + memorandum applying Winter factors;
2) Declarations and exhibits proving immediacy and irreparable harm;
3) FRCP 65(b)(1)(B) Certification of notice efforts (if ex parte);
4) Proposed TRO + Proposed Order to Show Cause (PI hearing date);
5) Certificate of Service and, if required, a proposed bond amount.

✅ Model Answer (Certification Template)
RULE 65(b)(1)(B) CERTIFICATION OF NOTICE EFFORTS

I, [Your Name], certify as follows:

1. Efforts to Give Notice. On August 24, 2025 at 09:15 and 14:30, I emailed and called counsel for Defendant ([email@firm.com], (555) 555‑5555) regarding Plaintiff’s intended TRO filing. I left voicemail messages and requested a same‑day meet‑and‑confer. I received no response. I also sent a copy of the TRO package via email to [secondary contact] at 18:05.

2. Why Notice Should Not Be Required. Immediate and irreparable harm will occur before an adversarial hearing can be held: Defendant plans to [imminent action] within 24 hours, which would cause non‑compensable injury to Plaintiff’s constitutional rights and professional standing. Providing additional notice risks precipitating the very harm sought to be prevented.

3. Attachments. Exhibits include email timestamps (Ex. A), call logs (Ex. B), and a sworn declaration detailing urgency (Ex. C).

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. 28 U.S.C. § 1746.

Executed on August 25, 2025.

💡 Reflection
Ex parte relief is the rare exception. Credibility and completeness carry the day: a specific, well‑documented certification, narrow relief, and a fast path to a PI hearing make a TRO request viable and appeal‑proof.
