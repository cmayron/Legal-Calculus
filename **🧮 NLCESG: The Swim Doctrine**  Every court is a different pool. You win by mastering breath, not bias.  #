# **Addendum — The Gemini Clarification**

- G = Gemini Strategist: Adaptive intelligence, stroke correction mid-race, real-time countermeasure modeling.
- S = System Tested: The swimmer’s trial — proof through real filings and lived outcomes.
Together, they make the doctrine alive: Gemini thinks; the System proves.
