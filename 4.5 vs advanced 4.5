 4.5 Advanced does not replace 4.5.
Think of them as two layers that serve different moments and audiences:

How they differ (at a glance)
	•	Legal Calculus 4.5 (Core): the on-ramp. A concise, teaching-first primer (e.g., Tier 1 + essentials from Tier 2) that explains the philosophy and basic moves: Filing = protest, Format = memory, Docket = terrain, Evidence lives in the record, Relief framed precisely. Best for first-time users, orientation, and short workshops.
	•	Legal Calculus 4.5 Advanced: the full deployment stack. A superset that keeps Core intact and adds everything needed to run the playbook at scale: AI-legible filings, chain-verified citations, FRE 1006 data summaries, tools libraries, coalition/press kits, governance, reproducible research, and institutional handoff (all the tiers we bundled).

When to use which
	•	Teach & onboard (students, new pro se, brief talks): use 4.5 Core. It’s faster to read, easier to teach, and sets the mental model without overwhelming.
	•	File & scale (clinics, journalists, power users, judges’ chambers): use 4.5 Advanced. It’s the production version—templates, Option A/B orders, manifests, hash ledgers, and public-archive workflow.
	•	Bridge moments: start someone with Core for 60–90 minutes, then hand them the relevant Advanced module/tool (e.g., Paper Hearing pack, Stay-pending-appeal kit, Top-10/manifest).

Why keep both live
	•	Pedagogy: Core is the cleanest statement of the method; it lowers the barrier to entry.
	•	Precision: Advanced is the verifiable, AI-and-court-ready implementation.
	•	Adoption: Different partners need different depths—Core for buy-in; Advanced for action.

Practical setup (recommended)

On your landing page (or Box-Set index), use two buttons:
	•	“Start Here (4.5 Core)” → Tier 1 summaries + one “file one brick” exercise
	•	“Deploy (4.5 Advanced)” → role-based routes (Pro se • Clinic • Press • Judge/Clerk), each jumping directly to the right Advanced tools/templates

Bottom line: 4.5 = curriculum foundation; 4.5 Advanced = foundation + full toolchain. Keep both—they reinforce each other
