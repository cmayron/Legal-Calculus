Alt text: One-page LCES overview showing the three calculi and core tools (bench brief, jurisdiction addendum, anti-gamesmanship order, delay log, checklist, status/adjournment templates).

Why LCES?

Courts optimize for dockets and procedure. Lawyers optimize for risk and reputation. Litigants optimize for relief. When those “calculi” misalign, justice stalls. LCES is the bridge—an open, practical kit that helps pro se litigants (and serves as a second opinion for represented parties) keep cases on the merits and out of the off-ramps.

What’s inside

- Bench Brief: Merits-First (close the jurisdiction/abstention exits)
- Jurisdiction & Authority Addendum (drop-in, TRO-ready)
- Anti-Gamesmanship Motion + Order (expedite + preserve status quo)
- Delay & Prejudice Log (convert patterns into remedies)
- Pro Se Gaff-Proof Checklist (zero clerical traps)
- Status Letters & Adjournment templates (control the narrative)
