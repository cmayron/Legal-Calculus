Legal Calculus is a simple, structured method that helps a self-represented person create court-ready filings using a clear workflow:

# **1. Start With the Human**

You begin the process.

You decide:

- Which court? (jurisdiction)
- Who are the parties?
- What are the facts?
- What are you asking the court to do?
- What deadlines apply?
- Has everyone been properly served?

If you don’t know the rules, call the clerk.

Clerks can tell you the procedure — not legal advice.

# **2. Architect AI — The Blueprint Designer**

Once you know the rules, you tell the Architect AI:

“This is my court, case type, and what the clerk told me. Build me a checklist and outline for the filing.”

Architect AI gives you:

- the required sections
- formatting rules
- page limits
- certificate requirements
- exhibit labeling
- local-rule guidance
- a step-by-step sequence for filing

This becomes your blueprint.

# **3. Builder AI — The Drafting Engine**

You give the blueprint to the Builder AI:

“Create my draft filing using this outline. Follow every section and rule.”

Builder AI produces:

- the complaint
- motion
- TRO
- objection
- or other filing

…in the correct structure, using the facts you provided.

It drafts like a paralegal following a plan — not inventing anything.

# **4. Inspector AI — The Procedural Check**

Before you file, you ask the Inspector AI:

“Compare this draft to the local rules, clerk instructions, and checklist. What’s missing? What’s non-compliant?”

Inspector AI checks:

- caption
- jurisdiction statements
- formatting rules
- signatures
- service method
- exhibit list
- deadlines
- required notices
- certificates

It acts like a procedural building inspector.

# **5. Human Review — Final Truth & Accuracy Check**

You read the draft and confirm:

- Are all facts true?
- Are all parties correct?
- Is this the relief you really want?
- Are all attachments included?

You finalize service and file with the clerk.

# **Why This Helps Pro Se Litigants**

Because it gives you:

- structure (so filings aren’t rejected)
- confidence (you’re following real rules)
- clarity (one step at a time)
- consistency (same process every time)
- fairness (format removes bias)
- preservation (your record is clean for appeal)

It doesn’t replace a lawyer — it replaces chaos.

This method mirrors how law firms operate internally (partner → senior associate → junior → compliance), but rebuilt for one person using AI tools safely and responsibly.
