# **1. Start With the Human**

You begin the process.

You decide:

- Which court? (jurisdiction)
- Who are the parties?
- What are the facts?
- What are you asking the court to do?
- What deadlines apply?
- Has everyone been properly served?

If you don’t know the rules, call the clerk.

Clerks can tell you the procedure — not legal advice.

# **2. Architect AI — The Blueprint Designer**

Once you know the rules, you tell the Architect AI:

“This is my court, case type, and what the clerk told me. Build me a checklist and outline for the filing.”

Architect AI gives you:

- the required sections
- formatting rules
- page limits
- certificate requirements
- exhibit labeling
- local-rule guidance
- a step-by-step sequence for filing

This becomes your blueprint.

# **3. Builder AI — The Drafting Engine**

You give the blueprint to the Builder AI:

“Create my draft filing using this outline. Follow every section and rule.”

Builder AI produces:

- the complaint
- motion
- TRO
- objection
- or other filing

…in the correct structure, using the facts you provided.

It drafts like a paralegal following a plan — not inventing anything.

# **4. Inspector AI — The Procedural Check**

Before you file, you ask the Inspector AI:

“Compare this draft to the local rules, clerk instructions, and checklist. What’s missing? What’s non-compliant?”

Inspector AI checks:

- caption
- jurisdiction statements
- formatting rules
- signatures
- service method
- exhibit list
- deadlines
- required notices
- certificates

It acts like a procedural building inspector.

# **5. Human Review — Final Truth & Accuracy Check**

You read the draft and confirm:

- Are all facts true?
- Are all parties correct?
- Is this the relief you really want?
- Are all attachments included?

You finalize service and file with the clerk.

# **Why This Helps Pro Se Litigants**

Because it gives you:

- structure (so filings aren’t rejected)
- confidence (you’re following real rules)
- clarity (one step at a time)
- consistency (same process every time)
- fairness (format removes bias)
- preservation (your record is clean for appeal)

It doesn’t replace a lawyer — it replaces chaos.

This method mirrors how law firms operate internally (partner → senior associate → junior → compliance), but rebuilt for one person using AI tools safely and responsibly.

Exactly right. The Legal Calculus workflow recognizes that **procedural compliance comes first**— before you can even argue your case, you need to get through the courthouse door.

The initial human checklistaddresses the gatekeeping questions: correct jurisdiction, proper parties, service requirements, and deadlines. Getting any of these wrong means rejection before the merits are even considered.

And you've identified the hidden complexity: there are multiple layers of rules that can trip you up:

- **Federal or state procedural rules** (the general framework)
- **Local court rules** (district-specific variations)
- **Individual judge preferences** (standing orders, chambers practices, docket management styles)

This is why the Architect AI stepis designed to capture not just the general rules, but local-rule guidanceand formatting specifics. And why calling the clerkis built into the process — clerks know their court's quirks.

The Inspector AIthen acts as the final procedural gatekeeper, checking compliance before filing. It's specifically designed to catch the "quirky rules" that vary by court and judge.

The system acknowledges that **procedure can be as important as substance** — especially for pro se litigants who don't have institutional knowledge of a particular courthouse's culture.

# **6. Evidence-Based Learning Loop — AI Learns From Court Records**

As AI tools are used across courts, they analyze:

- **Docket records** — which filings were accepted, rejected, or amended
- **Court orders** — how judges interpret rules and respond to arguments
- **Compliance patterns** — what formatting, structure, and procedural steps succeed
- **Judge-specific tendencies** — preferences, standing orders, and decision patterns

This creates a feedback loop where:

- The AI gets smarter with each case filed
- Guardrails become more precise and court-specific
- Checklists evolve based on real-world outcomes
- Success rates improve as the system learns what works

**The result:** AI doesn't just follow static rules — it learns from living court records to predict what will pass procedural review and what won't.

This transforms AI from a static template engine into an adaptive compliance system that improves with use, making access to justice more reliable over time.
