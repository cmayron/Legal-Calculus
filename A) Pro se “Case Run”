Goal: turn facts → filings → record → appeal-ready archive.

```
1.	Intake & triage

```

Paste the facts, deadlines (exact dates), relief sought, posture, and exhibits list.

You get: a risk/priority map + JC/LCa “threat alerts” (what the judge/lawyer will do next).

```
2.	Module map

```

I map your matter to LC + LCA (teaching), FG + FGA (quick plays), and flag JC/LCa counters you should expect.

```
3.	Plan & checklist

```

A dated todo (serve, file, certify, track), with proof-of-service and docket-watch steps.

```
4.	Drafts

```

Complaint / motion / memo / certificate / proposed order—structured to LC format (clean captions, numbered facts, exhibits, TOA skeleton).

```
5.	Evidence pack

```

Exhibit index, labels, and “memory anchors” so silence can’t erase the record.

```
6.	Service + docket watch

```

COS text, mail/efile steps, and a “what to do if clerk delays” script (mailbox rule, preservation notices).

```
7.	Hearing kit

```

30/60/90-second opening, trap→counter cards, status checklist, debrief log.

```
8.	Archive & appeal posture

```

LC-31 packaging (“The Archive Is the Appeal”): a clean bundle you can refile/appeal from.

AI roles

```
•	ChatGPT-5 Thinking: orchestrates reasoning, drafts, and checklists.

•	“JudgeSim” (JC): injects likely court reflexes (delay, discretion) and how to pre-empt.

•	“LawyerSim” (LCa): injects opposing tactics and counters.

•	Verifier AI (e.g., Gemini 2.5): cross-checks cites/standards when needed; we quote primary sources when used.
