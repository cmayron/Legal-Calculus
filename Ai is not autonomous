AI and Human Intelligence in LCES Filings

Why the “Autonomous AI” Narrative Is False

Core Principle

The Legal Calculus Educational System (LCES) does not depend on autonomous or unsupervised artificial intelligence. AI serves solely as a drafting, structuring, and error-detection tool within a human-directed, iterative review process. Every filing is reviewed, revised, adopted, and submitted by a human filer, who remains fully accountable for its contents.

The False Premise: “AI Is Automatic”

The notion that an AI-assisted filing is “automatic,” “unchecked,” or “hallucinatory by default” is based on a false premise. LCES explicitly rejects:

- Autonomous AI authorship
- Unreviewed AI outputs
- One-pass generation followed by submission

Instead, LCES operates through repeated human-in-the-loop refinement, often involving dozens of revisions. Iteration is not a sign of unreliability; it is a testament to quality control.

The LCES Iterative Workflow (Human-In-The-Loop)

Step 1: AI-Assisted Drafting  
AI tools assist with organization, formatting, and synthesis of information provided by the human filer.

Step 2: Human Review and Correction  
The human filer reviews each draft for:
- Factual accuracy
- Contextual accuracy
- Legal relevance
- Procedural compliance

Step 3: Iterative Refinement  
Revisions are made repeatedly—sometimes 20–30+ versions—to:
- Eliminate ambiguity
- Correct formatting issues
- Align exhibits, captions, and record citations
- Ensure clarity for the court

Step 4: Human Adoption and Filing  
Only after thorough review and approval does the human filer adopt the final version and submit it. At no point does AI “decide,” “submit,” or “certify” a filing.

Why “AI Hallucination” Is Not an Argument
