Defendants

Case No. 2:25-cv-02480-SHD



EXHIBIT – EMAIL NOTICE TO ARIZONA ATTORNEY GENERAL RE: LACK OF FORMAL SERVICE



Subject: Follow-up Regarding Service and Lack of Appearance — Mayron v. Touhill

Dear [Assistant Attorney General's Name],

This is to confirm that as of today’s date, I have not received any formal Notice of Appearance, responsive pleading, or waiver of service from your office in Mayron v. Judge Jennifer Ryan-Touhill, et al., Case No. 2:25-cv-02480-SHD (D. Ariz.).

As a reminder, I served the Arizona Attorney General’s Office by certified mail and filed multiple service-related notices with the Court. These filings were later stricken without explanation.

While I did receive a general acknowledgment email from your office, no formal action has followed. Please let me know if your office intends to enter a formal appearance or file a response.

This email serves as a procedural record confirming that I did not receive service of any formal appearance. I am preserving this issue for appeal.

Respectfully,
Charles Mayron, MD, FACS
Pro Se Plaintiff
