Based on the article "Justice by Code — The End of Judicial Discretion," here is an overview of the key arguments.

Core Argument

The central thesis is that the era of human judicial discretion in the legal system is ending. The author, Charles Mayron, argues this is a positive development, as human discretion is often marred by inconsistency, bias, and a focus on expediency over legal accuracy. He asserts that advanced AI is rapidly becoming a better, more consistent alternative.

The Problem and the Solution

According to the text, the problem with discretion is that it leads to unequal outcomes and unfairness, particularly for pro se litigants. The solution AI brings is a system that is impartial and objective. AI processes legal inputs—such as facts, rules, and deadlines—and provides consistent, unbiased outputs. It "doesn't care who you are," making justice based on law, not luck.

The Role of LCES

The Legal Calculus Education System (LCES) is presented as a crucial tool for this transition. It is described as a first-generation interface that teaches individuals how to format their cases, create records, and file in a way that can be understood by future AI-based legal systems. The author states that as algorithms increasingly become the "judge," knowing how to structure a case for AI will become essential for success.

The Transition and a Call to Action

The article argues that this transition is already underway, with AI models advancing from language processing to understanding entire procedural systems. The author predicts that within a generation, human judges will be the exception. He concludes with a call to action for individuals to learn "structured justice" using systems like LCES, understand how to be a "pattern-maker" for AI, and diligently document their cases to help build the data set for future justice systems.
