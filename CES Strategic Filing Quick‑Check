**Commencement = Filing Edition)**

*Use this 60‑second checklist before you file a rule‑only NPT motion.*

**1) Evidence Hierarchy**

□ Lead with irrefutable proof of RECEIPT (e.g., USPS PS 3811 cards dated 8/20/2025).

□ Position arguable evidence (e.g., clerk return notices like 8/7/2025) as ALTERNATIVE support.

**2) Terminology Precision**

□ Say “proof of receipt” / “clerk return notice,” not “file‑stamp,” unless you truly have one.

□ State the legal point plainly: receipt by the Clerk fixes the filing date; docketing is ministerial.

**3) Procedural Clarity — One Ask, One Order**

□ Submit ONE operative motion labeled “Supersedes Prior Motion/Reply.”

□ Lodge ONE Proposed Order that EXACTLY matches the relief (no duplicate orders).

**4) Internal Consistency**

□ Motion, proposed order, and exhibits use the SAME dates, terms, and relief language.

□ Cross‑check every reference (e.g., “associate related submissions accordingly,” Rule 4(i) line).

**5) Hierarchy of Claims (Primary → Alternative → Supplemental)**

□ PRIMARY: Deem filed as of 8/20/2025 (USPS receipts).

□ ALTERNATIVE: Deem filed as of 8/7/2025 (clerk return notice).

□ SUPPLEMENTAL: Rule 4(i) runs from issuance of summons AFTER correction (legal impossibility).

**6) Preempt the Attack**

□ Local Rule formatting/caption issues are CURABLE; they do not nullify commencement.

□ Frame returns as ultra vires front‑desk actions; commencement already occurred on receipt.

**7) Exhibit Crosswalk (fill before filing)**

□ A‑1 (8/7/25 clerk return): proof of tender/receipt → ALTERNATIVE date.

□ A‑2 (8/20 USPS + 8/21 return): irrefutable proof of receipt → PRIMARY date.

□ B (COA order 8/18 + 9/3 entry): mis‑routing context (attach certified copy).

□ C (screenshots): visual docket history showing administrative mis‑routing.

□ D/E (9/15 + 10/03 filings): diligence and corrective efforts.

**8) 30‑Second Hearing Script**

“Under Rules 3 and 5.1, filing is complete on receipt by the Clerk; docketing is ministerial. Our PRIMARY proof of receipt is 8/20/2025 (USPS). Alternatively, 8/7/2025 is shown by the clerk return notice. Form issues are curable and cannot erase commencement. We ask the Court to set the filing date nunc pro tunc to 8/20/2025 (or 8/7/2025 in the alternative), confirm jury demand, and clarify that Rule 4(i) runs from issuance of a proper summons after correction.”

*LCES principle: Strategic positioning wins—lead with proof, eliminate ambiguity, align every element.*
