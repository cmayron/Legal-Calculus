# Evidence Preservation as Ritual

## Introduction
Evidence is the lifeblood of justice.
Without preservation, truth dissolves into silence.
Legal Calculus encodes evidence preservation not only as a technical practice, but as a ritual — a repeatable act of coalition memory.

---

## The Ritual of Preservation
1. **Invocation**
   - Begin with intent: declare the purpose of preservation.
   - Example: “This record is preserved to protect truth against erasure.”

2. **Collection**
   - Gather documents, recordings, and metadata.
   - Use standardized checklists to ensure completeness.
   - Treat each artifact as sacred: handle with care, label with provenance.

3. **Encoding**
   - Store evidence in redundant formats (digital + physical).
   - Apply metadata (`forkwatch.json`) to record origin, date, and chain of custody.
   - Encode doctrine into coalition repositories for transparency.

4. **Safeguarding**
   - Secure backups in multiple trusted locations.
   - Encrypt sensitive materials while maintaining accessibility for coalition review.
   - Ritualize the act of backup — a scheduled ceremony of renewal.

5. **Transmission**
   - Share evidence through coalition channels.
   - Use GitHub Issues or Discussions to document context.
   - Every transmission is a teaching act: evidence becomes curriculum.

## Symbolic Meaning
- **Preservation as Memory** → safeguarding collective truth against institutional erasure.
- **Preservation as Ritual** → transforming technical acts into ceremonies of justice.
- **Preservation as Teaching** → each preserved artifact becomes a lesson in procedural literacy.

---

## Coalition Practice
- New members rehearse preservation drills as part of onboarding.
- Cue cards and flowcharts guide the ritual steps.
- Merged pull requests encode preserved evidence into doctrine, celebrated as ceremonial publishing.

---

## Conclusion
Evidence preservation is more than compliance.
It is a ritual of resistance, a ceremony of truth, and a cornerstone of the People’s Law School.
Through Legal Calculus, every act of preservation becomes both a shield and a teaching artifact.
