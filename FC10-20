FG-11 — The Gatekeeper’s Delay
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Delay is the clerk’s quietest weapon.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: By “processing” slowly, clerks shape outcomes without issuing rulings. Time lost is justice denied.
	•	📝 Assignment: Draft a one-paragraph notice to file if the docket does not show your motion after 14 days.
	•	✅ Model Response: “Plaintiff notes Motion filed DATE not yet docketed. Delay prejudices ability to seek relief. Request confirmation.”
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Delay is suppression in disguise.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: An hourglass spilling sand over a courthouse.

FG-12 — Lost, or Made to Be Lost
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Lost filings are often deliberate.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: A “lost” brief is an old tactic. Always carry duplicates, receipts, proof of mailing.
	•	📝 Assignment: Write three backup strategies if your filing is “lost.”
	•	✅ Model Response: 1) Certified mail receipts. 2) Scanned stamped copy. 3) Email copy to chambers.
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Redundancy is resistance.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: A filing cabinet with papers marked “misplaced” but still glowing.

FG-13 — The Rejection Notice
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Rejection is often discretionary, not mandatory.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: Clerks reject for trivial “format errors.” Challenge these politely but firmly.
	•	📝 Assignment: Draft a two-line objection to a rejection notice.
	•	✅ Model Response: “Rejection not supported by rule. Filing complies with Rule X. Request docketing.”
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Every “no” deserves a record.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: A stamped “REJECTED” fading under a “FILED” overlay.

⸻

FG-14 — Non-Service as Strategy
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Opponents exploit non-service to erase you.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: If you don’t receive documents, you’re already behind. Courts rarely enforce service rules unless forced.
	•	📝 Assignment: Draft a notice of non-service.
	•	✅ Model Response: “Plaintiff notes no service of Motion filed DATE. Prejudice results. Request proper service.”
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Document their silence, not just yours.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: An empty mailbox outside a courthouse.

⸻

FG-15 — The Phantom Docket
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Parallel internal dockets may hide your filings.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: Clerks keep notes invisible to the public docket. Recognize that “what you see” may not be all.
	•	📝 Assignment: Ask: What evidence would reveal shadow entries? Draft one question.
	•	✅ Model Response: “Does the Court maintain internal notes regarding Plaintiff’s filings not reflected on public docket?”
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Transparency ends at the clerk’s desk.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: Two overlapping docket books, one visible, one shadowed.

⸻

FG-16 — Email ≠ Filing
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Emailing chambers does not equal docketing.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: Courts exploit pro se misunderstanding by letting emails vanish. Only stamped filings count.
	•	📝 Assignment: Draft a line reminding yourself: “Email ≠ Filed.”
	•	✅ Model Response: Sticky note: “Until stamped, it does not exist.”
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Convenience is a trap.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: An inbox tray marked “ignored.”

⸻

FG-17 — Electronic Portals as Filters
	•	⚖️ Core Message: E-filing portals filter more than they reveal.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: Portals crash, reject, or delay filings. This is systemic, not accidental.
	•	📝 Assignment: Write three backup methods if the portal fails.
	•	✅ Model Response: 1) Email chambers. 2) Overnight mail. 3) Hand-deliver with receipt.
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Redundancy breaks the filter.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: A digital gate labeled “error 500.”

⸻

FG-18 — The Clerk’s Smile
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Politeness masks suppression.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: A clerk may smile while rejecting your filing. Never confuse courtesy for compliance.
	•	📝 Assignment: Journal one moment where politeness concealed denial.
	•	✅ Model Response: “Clerk said, ‘we’ll take care of it,’ but docket showed no entry.”
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Soft words hide hard power.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: A smiling face in front of a locked gate.

⸻

FG-19 — Missing Signatures
	•	⚖️ Core Message: “Missing signature” is the most common rejection trick.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: Even when signed, clerks claim missing verification. Always include extra certifications.

	•	✅ Model Response: Caption, numbered paragraphs, notary line, certificate of service.
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Over-signature > under-signature.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: A bold handwritten signature glowing on paper.

⸻

FG-20 — Gatekeeping Is Policy, Not Accident
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Clerk obstruction is systemic, not individual.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: Training encourages obstruction to protect judicial efficiency. View it as institutional, not personal.
	•	📝 Assignment: Write a reflection on how recognizing policy—not malice—changes your strategy.
	•	✅ Model Response: “By seeing obstruction as policy, I prepare formats that cannot be denied, rather than blaming one clerk.”
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Treat the system, not the symptom.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: A manual titled “Procedural Filters” held by a clerk.
