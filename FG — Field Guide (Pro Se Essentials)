# **FG — Field Guide (Pro Se Essentials)**

**FG-105 — Courtesy vs. Statutory Service (and “Actual Notice”)**

Teach:

- Statutory service perfects jurisdiction; courtesy (FedEx/email) proves actual notice and no prejudice.
- Use courtesy to strengthen Rule 4(m) discretion—not as a substitute for CPLR 307(2).
Drop-in (Reply §II.A):

# Defendants have actual notice (appearance + courtesy deliveries); a short Rule 4(m) extension with deem-timely language imposes no burden and avoids duplicate filings. See Rule 1.

**FG-106 — DOH vs. NYSED: Who to Serve (OPMC discipline)**

Teach:

- Licensure → NYSED/Office of Professions; discipline (OPMC) → DOH under Public Health Law § 230.
- For OPMC discipline: Commissioner of Health (CPLR 307(2)) + AG (CPLR 307(1)).
Drop-in (Reply §II.A):

# Physician licensure is administered by NYSED, but discipline is prosecuted by DOH/OPMC under PHL § 230. Thus CPLR 307(2) service is directed to the Commissioner of Health; any NYSED mailing is courtesy only.

**FG-107 — Weekend Delivery Pitfalls**

Teach:

- Weekend “business closed” scans don’t complete service.
- Time Certified RRR/Express for weekday delivery to the principal office.
Decision rule: If in doubt, Monday > Saturday.

**FG-108 — Pre-Deprivation Due Process (Mathews in 3)**

Teach:

- Ask for relief before irreversible steps (exam; NPDB).
- Bullets: Private interest (license/NPDB); Risk of error (paper-only + misattribution after notice); Minimal burden (status-quo pause).
Drop-in:

# A later Article 78 cannot unwind compelled exam or NPDB stigma; Mathews requires a meaningful opportunity at a meaningful time.

**FG-109 — Proof Pack Discipline (RRR/Express/FedEx)**

Teach:

- Always capture: PS-3800 (barcode), USPS tracking PDF, PS-3811 (later), optional FedEx POD, and an Affidavit template.
- Caption exhibits so statutory vs courtesy is unmistakable.
