FG-1 — Filing Is Memory
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Every filing is a seed of memory that resists erasure.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: Courts suppress voices through silence, but the docket preserves what is written. The act of filing itself is protest, regardless of outcome.
	•	📝 Assignment: Draft a one-page filing where the goal is not victory, but preservation of truth.
	•	✅ Model Response: A simple declaration noting a timeline of retaliation, signed and submitted, even if dismissed, becomes permanent evidence.
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: The system forgets by design; the docket remembers if you insist.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: A stone tablet emerging from scattered papers, engraved with the word “FILED.”

FG-2 — Format Is Force
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Proper format transforms voice into something courts must acknowledge.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: Even hostile judges or clerks cannot easily discard filings that comply with rules. Format is armor.
	•	📝 Assignment: Take a rough narrative and reformat into caption, numbered paragraphs, and certificate of service.
	•	✅ Model Response: A story of retaliation becomes a verified complaint with caption, jurisdiction, facts, and claim.
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: The same words gain legal weight when placed in structured form.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: A raw block of marble becoming a carved, balanced column.

⸻

FG-3 — The Clerk’s Gate
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Clerks are the first line of suppression and delay.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: Late docketing, rejection notices, and “lost” mail are not accidents—they are systemic friction. Recognize the gate.
	•	📝 Assignment: Write down three strategies you will use if a filing is delayed or returned.
	•	✅ Model Response: 1) Keep stamped copies. 2) Email chambers. 3) Re-file with explanation.
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Expect suppression at the door; prepare to push through.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: A medieval gate with a clerk holding keys, blocking entry.

⸻

FG-4 — Silence ≠ Dismissal
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Court silence is not dismissal—it is a tactic.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: Judges often refuse to rule to exhaust or demoralize pro se litigants. That silence is procedural denial.
	•	📝 Assignment: Write a one-paragraph notice you could file when a motion is ignored for 60 days.
	•	✅ Model Response: “Plaintiff respectfully notes the Court’s inaction on Motion X filed DATE. Delay prejudices rights. Record preserved.”
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Silence is strategy; the record is your rebuttal.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: An empty bench with a loud stamp reading “FILED.”

⸻

FG-5 — Judicial Efficiency ≠ Fairness
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Judges prize efficiency over justice.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: Retaliation cases are buried by labeling them “too complex” or “time-consuming.” The system rewards docket reduction, not truth.
	•	📝 Assignment: Draft a motion paragraph explaining why efficiency cannot override due process.
	•	✅ Model Response: “Efficiency cannot justify denial of a hearing where federal rights are at stake. See Mathews v. Eldridge.”
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Never accept efficiency as fairness.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: A scale with “time” outweighing “justice,” yet justice still presses upward.

⸻

FG-6 — Default ≠ Consent
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Not responding does not equal agreement.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: Courts sometimes treat silence as waiver. Clarify explicitly: lack of reply ≠ consent.
	•	📝 Assignment: Write a notice clarifying that failure to respond preserves, not waives, your rights.
	•	✅ Model Response: “Non-response is not concession. Plaintiff preserves all claims and objections.”
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Default protects power, not truth.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: Two empty chairs, one labeled “default,” with a locked file still on the table.

⸻

FG-7 — Volume ≠ Vexatious
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Filing often is not harassment; it is survival.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: Pro se litigants are smeared as “vexatious” when they persist. Frequency ≠ frivolousness.
	•	📝 Assignment: Draft a two-sentence response to an accusation of vexatiousness.
	•	✅ Model Response: “Volume reflects systemic denial. Each filing preserved rights. None were frivolous.”
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Persistence is painted as pathology. Do not yield.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: A wall of filings forming a protective barricade.

⸻

FG-8 — The Docket Is the Battlefield
	•	⚖️ Core Message: The fight occurs in filings, not courtrooms.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: Few whistleblowers reach trial; the record is the arena. Every docket entry is a strategic move.
	•	📝 Assignment: Map your filings as “moves” in a game. Which move forces a reply?
	•	✅ Model Response: Motion to strike, notice of non-service, supplemental affidavit—all moves force recognition.
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: The battlefield is paper, not oral argument.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: A chessboard where the pieces are legal filings.

⸻

FG-9 — Appeal Starts Early
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Preserve appeal from the first filing.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: Courts assume you’ll lose. The record you build is your appeal brief in waiting.
	•	📝 Assignment: Write a note to yourself: “Every filing = future appeal exhibit.”
	•	✅ Model Response: Adding clear citations, attaching exhibits, preserving objections in every motion.
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Appeal begins with day one, not after judgment.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: A ladder climbing from “trial court” up to “appeals.”

⸻

FG-10 — Misclassification = Evasion
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Courts mislabel filings to evade addressing them.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: Your “appeal” becomes a “special action”; your “motion” becomes “correspondence.” Recognize this tactic.
	•	📝 Assignment: Draft a two-sentence objection to misclassification.
	•	✅ Model Response: “Plaintiff objects to misclassification. Relief sought is specific and proper under Rule X.”
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Language games conceal suppression. Call it out.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: A stamp marking “MISC” on a document, hiding its true caption.
