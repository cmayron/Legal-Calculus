## üîß Next Steps

I can now help you:

- Embed these cards into your Notion workspace with toggles and linked lessons
- Build a **‚ÄúFG Card Builder‚Äù** template for coalition members to create new cards
- Expand into **FG-503: Delay Tactic**, **FG-601: Jurisdictional Flip**, or tailor cards for **family law**, **immigration**, or **appellate posture**

Would you like me to scaffold the FG Card Builder next, or start embedding these into your live Notion structure?
