# FG-342 • TRO/PI — Show Noncompensable Harm & Tailored Relief

**Trigger Phrase:** “There’s no irreparable harm.” | “Money damages can fix this.”

**Action Steps**

- File declarations that show immediate, non-monetary harm (rights, safety, license, speech).
- Map each Winter element to dated facts; attach an element grid.
- Draft a narrowly tailored proposed order that preserves the status quo.
- Address bond: request nominal bond with hardship/public-interest facts.
- Explain why delay = ongoing harm; include T+ timeline bullets.

- proposed order
- draft bond paragraph
- COS
- calendar hearing dates

**Evidence to Gather**

- Declarations
- dated photos/records
- emails/letters
- policy/disciplinary notices
- timeline bullets

**One-liner Counter (hallway-ready)**

“Harm is immediate and not fixable by money; our order is narrow and preserves the status quo.”

**Anchors (LC/FG/Rule)**

LC-14 Winter factors; proposed order with specific verbs/time/place; declarations with dated facts

**JC Reflex + counter**

JC-37 Extraordinary Remedy rhetoric; JC-38 Tailoring to Nullify; JC-39 Bond Requirement

**LCa Tactic + counter**

LCa-55 No Irreparable Harm; LCa-56 High Bond Leverage; LCa-52 In Limine Omnibus

**FG Core**

Injunctions turn on proof: show noncompensable harm and offer a narrow fix.

**FG Lesson**

Tie each Winter factor to a dated record cite. Relief must be the smallest order that stops the harm.

**FG Assignment**

Draft a 90‑second opening hitting all four Winter elements and the nominal bond ask.

**FG Model Answer**

“We meet Winter: (1) Likelihood on Claim X at ¶¶__ ; (2) Irreparable—rights harm not fixable by money at ¶¶__ ; (3) Equities—narrow pause; (4) Public interest—law compliance. Order text: ‘Defendant shall [specific act] until [date/condition].’ Nominal bond is warranted given hardship and public interest.”

**FGA Expanded Notes**

Lead with harm and tailoring; courts trust specificity. Include a one‑paragraph proposed order. If pushed on bond, propose $0 or nominal with hardship facts.

# FG-378 • Compel Arbitration — Challenge Delegation & Unconscionability

**Trigger Phrase:** “The arbitrator decides arbitrability.” | “Compel arbitration under the FAA.”

**Action Steps**

- Challenge the delegation clause specifically (no clear, unmistakable delegation on this dispute).
- Raise formation and unconscionability (procedural + substantive) with affidavits.
- Identify carve‑outs and plead claims to remain in court; argue waiver by litigation conduct.
- Request limited discovery on formation if facts are contested.
- If compelled, seek local seat/rules and narrow, time‑limited confidentiality.

**Prep Checklist**

- Declaration on formation

- proposed order on seat/rules/confidentiality scope

**Evidence to Gather**

- Original agreement
- onboarding records
- emails
- policy manuals

- billing/employment logs

**One-liner Counter (hallway-ready)**

“No clear delegation applies here; formation/unconscionability go to the court, and any arbitration must be local and fair.”

**Anchors (LC/FG/Rule)**

Delegation specificity; unconscionability elements; waiver by conduct; carve‑out text quoted

**JC Reflex + counter**

**LCa Tactic + counter**

LCa-21 Compel Arbitration; LCa-22 Delegation Clause; LCa-25 Seat/Rules Advantage; LCa-27 Confidentiality Default

**FG Core**

If they say ‘arbitrator decides,’ attack the delegation and show why the court decides.

**FG Lesson**

Courts need targeted challenges: delegation, formation, unconscionability, waiver. Always propose fair seat/rules as a fallback.

**FG Assignment**

Write a 2‑paragraph opposition section: (1) Delegation not clear/unmistakable; (2) Unconscionability and waiver with cites.

**FG Model Answer**

“The delegation clause does not clearly and unmistakably assign this dispute to an arbitrator. Even if the Court reaches enforcement, the agreement is unconscionable (procedural + substantive) on this record, and Defendant has waived arbitration by litigation conduct. Alternatively, any arbitration should be seated locally with neutral rules and time‑limited confidentiality.”

**FGA Expanded Notes**

Quote the exact clause language. Use facts (notice, cost, imbalance). Ask for limited formation discovery if needed; keep tone neutral.

# FG-455 • Younger Abstention — Bad Faith & Inadequate Forum Exception

**Trigger Phrase:** “The Court must abstain under Younger.”

**Action Steps**

- Document bad faith/harassment (retaliatory timeline; selective enforcement; shifting rationales).
- Show the state forum is inadequate for federal rights (no access, bias, or inability to raise claims).
- Seek narrow federal relief that does not enjoin core state proceedings, or ask for a limited stay instead of dismissal.
- Attach exhibits proving retaliatory motive and procedural blockage (docket delays, ignored filings).
- Preserve federal issues for appeal; request findings on exceptions.

**Evidence to Gather**

- Retaliation timeline
- letters/emails
- hearing notices
- transcripts
- clerk returns
- declarations

**One-liner Counter (hallway-ready)**

“Younger doesn’t apply where proceedings are in bad faith or the forum is inadequate; we seek narrow relief that respects comity.”

**Anchors (LC/FG/Rule)**

Bad‑faith exception; inadequacy of forum; narrow tailoring of relief; record exhibits

**JC Reflex + counter**

JC-43 Younger Expansion; JC-15 Stay/Abeyance

**LCa Tactic + counter**

LCa-36 Exhaustion/Primary Jurisdiction; LCa-11 Snap Removal (forum move patterns)

**FG Core**

Younger is not absolute—prove bad faith or an inadequate forum and tailor federal relief.

**FG Lesson**

Present a clean retaliation timeline and narrow remedy to respect comity while protecting federal rights.

**FG Assignment**

Draft a 1‑page exceptions section with three dated facts of bad faith and one paragraph of narrow relief.

**FG Model Answer**

“Younger abstention is improper: (1) Retaliatory motive shown by [date→act]; (2) Forum inadequate because [specific barrier]; (3) We request narrow relief that does not enjoin the state’s merits adjudication. The record (Exhs. A–D) shows ongoing harm and procedural obstruction.”

**FGA Expanded Notes**

Lead with dates and exhibits; avoid rhetoric. Offer the narrowest workable order. Always preserve issues for appeal.
