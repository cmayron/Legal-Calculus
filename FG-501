FG-501 — Modify or Vacate a Stay (After Opinion / New Facts)

⚖️ Core Message: When circumstances change, ask to modify a stay (scope/time) with new facts + pins—not a re-brief.

📖 Lesson Content:

Identify what changed (intervening law, compliance, mooted risk) with exhibit/date pins.

Narrow ask: shorten the window, carve out claims/paragraphs, or lift entirely.

Offer reporting (status at day 7/14) and an automatic lift date.

Attach a tick-box order (modify/lift; new dates).

📝 Assignment: Draft an 8-line motion to modify a stay, citing one new fact and one new authority.

✅ Model Response:

Title: Motion to Modify (or Vacate) Stay

1. Since the stay, Vendor PO was cancelled on 09/12 (Decl ¶7; Ex A:1).

2. Intervening authority clarifies the standard: [New Authority, 2025 WL ____] (pin).

3. Relief: modify stay to ¶3 only (parties only); carve out non-party vendors.

4. Sunset: stay expires on 09/30; automatic lift absent further order.

5. Reporting: status letter due day 7 and day 14 (≤3 pp; pins).

6. Scope guard: no effect on ¶¶1–2; no obligations on third-party vendors.

7. Pins: Order at Dkt 88:6; Appx Tab 3 p.2 (harm not reached page).

8. Tick-box order attached: □ Modify as stated □ Vacate in full □ Deny.

💡 Reflection Summary: Changed facts + narrow scope + dates turn a static stay into a signable update.

🎨 Visual Concept: A pause icon shrinking to a smaller bracketed ¶3 line with a calendar ribbon “09/30”.
