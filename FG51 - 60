FG-51 — Findings or It Didn’t Happen
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Appellate courts review findings, not vibes. No findings → reversible path.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: Force factor-tied findings (who/what/when) or note “not reached.” Findings convert narrative into reviewable law.
	•	📝 Assignment: Draft a one-sentence order line: “Court shall make findings on (a)–(d) within 21 days.”
	•	✅ Model Response: “Denying relief without findings on irreparable harm is error; remand for factor-tied findings.”
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: If it isn’t found, it’s not real on appeal.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: A checklist with four boxes; only one has a check.

FG-52 — Pin Discipline (Page • Line • Tab)
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Precision wins. “Dkt 18 at 2” beats “see record.”
	•	📖 Lesson Content: Use one convention: Dkt at page + Appx Tab p.#; dual-pin once, then the simple form.
	•	📝 Assignment: Convert three prose cites into strict pins.
	•	✅ Model Response: “(Dkt 18 at 2; Appx Tab 3 p.2).”
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Pins are bridges between claims and proof.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: Two pins (Dkt / Tab) snapping into one quote bubble.

FG-53 — Relief Text You Can Sign
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Give the court order language, not adjectives.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: Draft two lines max: primary (decide) + fallback (limited remand: task/time/scope).
	•	📝 Assignment: Write your two-line relief for the live issue.
	•	✅ Model Response: “Vacate and remand for findings on (a)–(d) within 21 days; 20-min harm-only hearing permitted.”
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Orders beat opinions when you’re drafting.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: A slim card labeled “Relief” with two checkboxes.

FG-54 — The One-Page Notice (Oxygen on Docket)
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Short notices keep the court honest without re-briefing.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: Use notices for delay, non-service, misclassification, amended authority; one paragraph + date/pin.
	•	📝 Assignment: Draft a 6-line “Notice of Delay” with the file date and prejudice line.
	•	✅ Model Response: “Motion filed 06/01 not docketed; delay prejudices emergency relief; record preserved.”
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Air + light = less suppression.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: A tiny oxygen mask labeled “NOTICE.”

⸻

FG-55 — One-Screen Roadmap
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Judges decide faster when your map fits on one screen.

	•	📝 Assignment: Build your one-screen roadmap for the live motion.
	•	✅ Model Response: “Q: Must court reach harm? Std: abuse (wrong test). Pins: Dkt 18:2; Tab 3 p.2; Ex A:1. Relief: vacate & remand 21d.”
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Maps reduce the work of belief.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: Four stacked tiles: Q • Std • Pins • Relief.

FG-56 — Status Letter that Helps, Not Whines
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Status = facts + dates + next step. No rhetoric.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: 120 words: what changed, when, where to verify (pin), what order language fits.
	•	📝 Assignment: Draft a 120-word status note with one proposed line of relief.
	•	✅ Model Response: “Since 07/15, no ruling on PI; harm ongoing (Decl ¶7). Relief: limited remand for findings in 21 days.”
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: A good status is a pre-order.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: A calendar dot connected to a tiny order strip.

FG-57 — Appendix Crosswalk (Issue → Proof)
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Crosswalks turn chaos into one-click verification.

	•	✅ Model Response: “Wrong test (Dkt 18:2) → skipped harm → likely different result → remand 21d for findings.”

	•	✅ Model Response: “Rule 58: 08/15 → +30 → 09/14 → weekend → 09/15 (11:59 PM local).”

⸻
