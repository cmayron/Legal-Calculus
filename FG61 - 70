FG-61 — Two-Question Strategy (Keep the Case Small)
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Frame ≤2 neutral questions so the panel can say yes/no without rewriting your case.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: Good questions: short, non-partisan, track governing tests, and point to clean pins. Bad questions: compound, fact-heavy, argumentative.
	•	📝 Assignment: Rewrite your issue into two neutral Qs under 18 words each.
	•	✅ Model Response: “Must a court make factor-tied findings before denying PI?” “Is harm ‘not reached’ reversible?”
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Small questions get big answers.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: Two neat question cards feeding one “ORDER” button.

FG-62 — Standards of Review (One Screen, One Line Each)

	•	📖 Lesson Content: Put de novo / abuse / clear error on one screen; one cite each; link every argument paragraph to its SoR.
	•	📝 Assignment: Draft a SoR box with three one-line standards and controlling citations.
	•	✅ Model Response: “Abuse: wrong test (cite). De novo: legal interpretation (cite). Clear error: definite/firm conviction (cite).”

	•	📝 Assignment: Write a 4-line legend mapping your cite conventions.
	•	✅ Model Response: “Cites are to PDF pages: ‘Dkt 18 at 2’; exhibits ‘Ex A at 1’; appendix ‘Tab 3 p.2’.”

FG-65 — Notice + Proposed Order (Pairs Win)

FG-66 — Clarify vs. Strike (Fix the Line, Not the Case)
	•	⚖️ Core Message: Ask the court to clarify misstatements; strike only when necessary.
	•	📖 Lesson Content: Quote the exact line; show the correcting pin; propose a one-sentence fix; avoid rhetoric.
	•	📝 Assignment: Draft a 6-line “clarify or, alternatively, strike” motion with one pin.
	•	✅ Model Response: “P.12 n.3 states ‘harm reached’; record shows ‘not reached’ (Dkt 18:2). Clarify; alternatively strike that phrase.”
	•	💡 Reflection Summary: Surgical requests earn trust.
	•	🎨 Visual Concept: A small redline bubble over a single footnote.
