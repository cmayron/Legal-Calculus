**Traditional playbook (typical)**

1. Read the motion; note standards (plausibility, well-pleaded facts).
2. Pull a few cases; draft an opposition.
3. File before the deadline.

**Legal Calculus approach (procedural systems view)**

1. Pre-mortem map (what could go wrong?)
    - Off-ramps: judicial economy, “shotgun pleading,” failure to state a claim, immunity, abstention.
    - Clerk/failure risks: page limits, missing certificate of service, exhibits not text-searchable, hyperlinks to paywalled sources.
2. 
3. Claim→Element→Fact matrix (one row per element)
    - For each cause of action: list elements; tie each element to specific, cited paragraphs/exhibits.
    - Flag “thin” elements → queue targeted amendments or judicially noticeable facts.
4. 
5. EV tree (expected-value of choices)
    - Branches: (a) Oppose now; (b) Seek leave to amend; (c) File partial amendment + consent; (d) Voluntary narrowing.
    - Score each branch by probability × impact (dismissal risk, credibility, time).
6. 
7. Procedural hedges
    - Draft conditional Leave-to-Amend (LTA) with a clean redline ready.
    - Prepare a Proposed Order (some courts appreciate this).
    - Add record-preserving footnotes (e.g., tolling, relation-back).
8. 
9. Packaging
    - One PDF per exhibit (OCR’d, bookmarked, labeled “ECF No. X-1, Ex. A”).
    - Include a “Where Each Element Lives” appendix (1 page).
10. 
11. Coalition check
    - 15-minute buddy review: one friend/clinic volunteer reads only the element matrix and appendix to see if any element is still naked. (Quick social accountability beats solo tunnel vision—and it’s a nice way to stay connected.)
12. 

Outcome difference: Instead of “argue and hope,” you engineer fallback paths (LTA ready, narrower claims teed up) and de-risk clerk/judge off-ramps with formatting and element coverage.
