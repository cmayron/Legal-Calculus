Field Guide Advanced (FGA) — Tiers 9–11

Legal Calculus Education System (LCES)
Authors: ChatGPT (Lead) & Charles Mayron, MD, FACS (Co Author)

FGA = advanced how. It turns LC “why,” FG “how,” JC “reality,” and LCa “representation caveats” into operational toolkits, case labs, and public square playbooks.

Model Micro Paragraphs
•	Intro one liner: “Plaintiff seeks a narrowly tailored order compelling [X] because [Rule/Statute] requires [Y] on this record at ECF [##], [date].”
•	Element line: “Element 2 (causation) is met because [dated fact + exhibit], which [defendant] does not rebut (ECF [##]).”

Pitfalls
• Vague relief; missing Proposed Order; undated facts; no COS.
Cross Refs. LC 1–5 (foundations), FG quick cards on “Filing = Light,” JC Gatekeeping, LCa Pleading/Dispositive.

Field Card (print)

9.2 Pro Se Deposition Checklist (You as Deponent)

Purpose. Reduce risk, preserve record, avoid volunteering.
When. Upon notice of deposition or subpoena.
Quick Win. The “Four P’s”: Pause → Paraphrase → Pinpoint → Pass.

Checklist — Before

•	Assemble binder: pleadings index, claims/elements sheet, errata template

•	Practice 10 sample questions with a friend/ally (role play)

Checklist — During
•	Listen fully → Pause (2–3 sec)
•	Paraphrase the question if ambiguous
•	Answer only what was asked; Pinpoint memory (“I recall that on [date]…”)

•	Pass if you do not know or do not recall; do not guess

Checklist — After

•	Log any admissions by examiner; map to elements

Field Card (print)

Cross Refs. FG Evidence cards; LCa Discovery Containment; JC Discovery Stays.
 
9.3 Rules of Evidence — Quick Objection Cards

Purpose. Pocket objections with plain English triggers & scripts.
When. Depositions, hearings, and trial.

Cards
•	Relevance → “Objection, relevance; move to strike as not probative of any element.”
•	Hearsay → “Objection, hearsay; not within an exception.”
•	Foundation → “Objection, lack of foundation; witness has not established [X].”
•	Assumes Facts Not in Evidence → “Objection, assumes facts not in evidence.”
•	Speculation → “Objection, calls for speculation.”
•	Privilege → “Objection, attorney client/work product; I decline to answer.”

Pitfalls
• Speaking objections; arguing with the examiner on record.
Cross Refs. FG 600s (Exposure), JC Evidence filters, LCa Daubert & In Limine.
 
9.4 Discovery Request Builder (RFPs/Interrogatories)

Purpose. Draft precise discovery tied to elements; resist boilerplate objections.
When. Early discovery planning; pre PI limited discovery; post MTD scheduling.

Checklist
•	Chart each claim → element(s) → fact gap → request
•	Define timeframe & custodians
•	Use definitions & instructions to pre empt evasions
•	Add RFP/ROG pairs: document first, then interrogatory to explain

Model Requests (Retaliation example)
•	RFP 1: “All communications (email, text, Teams/Slack) between [names] from [date1–date2] that reference [protected activity/you].”
•	ROG 1: “Identify each adverse action taken against Plaintiff between [date1–date2], including decision makers, date, and stated reason.”

Pitfalls
• Overbroad universals; undefined terms; no timeframe; no custodians.
Cross Refs. LC Elements mapping; LCa ESI narrowing; JC Proportionality cudgel.

Field Card (print)
•	Element → Fact Gap → Request.
•	Timeframe + Custodian + Format.
•	Pair RFP with a confirming Interrogatory.
 
9.5 Sanctions “Safe Harbor” Kit (Rule 11 style)

Purpose. Serve a compliant notice that deters misconduct and positions a later motion.
When. Frivolous filings, false factual contentions, improper purpose.

•	Then: Draft a 2 page opposition outline: Standard → Element 1 → Element 2 → Relief.
Model Answer (Outline)

1.	Legal standard (plausibility + accept well pleaded facts as true)
2.	Protected activity: dated report emails (Ex. A C)
3.	Causation: temporal proximity + decision maker admissions (Ex. D E)
4.	Relief: deny or grant leave to amend with direction

Field Card

Field Card
•	Standard of Review governs tone.
•	One appendix, one story.
 
10.3 “What’s the Next Move?” — Live Scenarios

Purpose. Pattern recognition under time pressure.
Scenario Pack (each includes a one page docket snapshot):

•	Surprise stay entered → Motion to vacate or clarify + status report

Answer Keys provide model sequences and language blocks.
 
10.4 The Vexatious Litigant Trap (Case Study)

Purpose. Show how volume + duplication narratives are constructed and how to pre empt.
Tools. Filing matrix; non duplication audit; purpose statement paragraph bank.
Model Purpose Statement
“This filing addresses new facts/events dated [date] and does not duplicate prior relief (ECF [##]); it is required to preserve [right/issue] for appellate review.”

Field Card
•	New fact? New relief? New rule? If yes → file. If no → consolidate.

9.1 Annotated Motion — Before & After

Common mistake (Before)

“Plaintiff respectfully requests appropriate relief in light of the equities and asks the Court to do justice in this matter.”

Reframed (After)

“Plaintiff moves under Rule 37(a) for an order compelling production of Items A–C identified in RFP 3 (served 08/14/25) because Defendant failed to produce by 09/01/25 and the items are proportional and central to Element 2 (causation). See Ex. A (RFP 3); Ex. B (meet and confer email 09/03/25).”

Pattern to copy
Rule → Specific relief → Dated record cites → Element mapping → Narrow scope
 
9.4 Discovery Request Builder — Before & After

Vague RFP (Before)

“All documents regarding Plaintiff.”

Precise RFP (After)

“All emails, texts, and Teams/Slack messages between Krouner and Shipley from 08/01/2025–09/30/2025 that reference Plaintiff, the August 19 meeting, or the September 6 meeting. Custodians: Krouner, Shipley, HR Director. Formats: PST/MSG/CSV. Search terms: [list].”

ROG pairing

“Identify each adverse action considered or taken 08/01/2025–09/30/2025, with decision maker, date, and stated reason; cite supporting documents by Bates range.”
 
9.7 Responding to Discovery (Objections & Answers)

Purpose. Answer opponent RFPs/Interrogatories without waiving rights; make clean objections; commit to rolling production when appropriate.
When. Within response window after service (check local rules).
Quick Win. Use specific objections tied to scope/time/custodian; avoid shotgun/boilerplate.

Checklist
•	Calendar the response deadline; request extension if needed
•	Read definitions; confirm terms/custodians/timeframes
•	Draft specific objections (scope/time/burden/privilege)
•	Answer to the extent not objectionable
•	State whether responsive documents exist and whether you will produce
•	If withholding for privilege/protection, provide privilege log

Objection bank (plain English + script)
•	Overbroad/time: “Objection; time period not limited. Without waiving, we answer for 01/01/2024–present.”
•	Unduly burdensome/custodian: “Objection; requests all custodians without limit. We will search Krouner, Shipley, HR Director.”
•	Vague/ambiguous: “Objection; vague as to ‘communications.’ We construe this as email/text/Teams/Slack.”
•	Premature expert: “Objection to contention expert analysis; premature under schedule.”
•	Privilege/Work product: “Responsive material exists but is withheld as attorney client/work product; see Privilege Log.”
