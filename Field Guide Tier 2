Tier 2 – Lawfare Resistance (Modules 6–12)

Purpose: Recognize and counter procedural tactics used to deny or delay pro se access, from misclassification to silence, and turn those tactics into evidence.

⸻

Module 6 – The Pro Se Trap: Procedure as Pretext
Core Message: Rules can be applied more harshly to pro se litigants as a way to avoid the merits.
Key Rules:
	•	Minor defects may be exaggerated to justify denial.
	•	Selective enforcement often shields high-volume courts.
	•	Document and compare treatment of pro se vs. represented parties.
Example: Arizona appellate court reclassified a civil appeal into a discretionary special action to bypass review.
Action Step: Collect comparable attorney-filed examples showing leniency where you faced strict enforcement.
Visual: Courtroom metal detector labeled “Procedure” letting lawyers through but stopping a pro se litigant — “Same Rule, Different Result.”

Module 7 – Framing Bad Faith: The Exception to Abstention
Core Message: You can defeat doctrines like Younger if you prove bad faith or harassment.
Key Rules:
	•	Show actions with no legitimate purpose except to harm your position.
	•	Present repeated patterns to demonstrate motive.
	•	Cite controlling precedent for bad faith exceptions.
Example: OPMC hearing was moved up six weeks immediately after whistleblower claims were filed.
Action Step: Tie each procedural abuse to motive using timelines and case law.
Visual: Two courtrooms linked by bridge labeled “Younger” with trapdoor “Bad Faith Exception.”

Module 8 – Misclassification = Evasion
Core Message: Changing your case’s classification can strip rights and dodge review.
Key Rules:
	•	Watch for orders re-labeling filings.
	•	Know the rights each classification grants.
	•	Move quickly to correct improper reclassification.
Example: Appeal reclassified to “special action” denied review entirely.
Action Step: File motion to correct classification and cite precedent keeping similar cases in appeal status.
Visual: Two courthouse doors — “Appeal” open vs. “Special Action” locked — “Change the Label, Change the Outcome.”

Module 9 – Silence ≠ Settlement
Core Message: Procedural silence can be a tactic to run out deadlines or avoid rulings.
Key Rules:
	•	Silence can delay until relief is moot.
	•	Opponents may withhold filings to trigger default.
	•	You can force action with targeted procedural moves.
Example: Court delay before TRO hearing allowed harm to occur without ruling.
Action Step: File a Motion to Expedite or Request for Status when silence stretches past norms.
Visual: Chess clock running while one side’s pieces are frozen — “Silence Is a Move — Answer It.”

Module 10 – Default ≠ Consent
Core Message: Failing to object can be treated as agreement by the court.
Key Rules:
	•	Many jurisdictions grant unopposed motions automatically.
	•	Short written objections preserve your rights.
	•	You can move to reconsider if caught off guard.
Example: Failure to timely oppose a motion to compel arbitration treated as implied consent.
Action Step: File at least a placeholder objection before response deadlines.
Visual: Blank signature line morphing into stamp “Agreed” — “Silence Signs for You.”

Module 11 – Volume ≠ Vexatious
Core Message: Multiple filings are legitimate if each serves a necessary purpose.
Key Rules:
	•	Every filing should add something new and relevant.
	•	Explain in major filings why supplemental submissions were needed.
	•	Maintain an index of filings and their purposes.
Example: Supplemental TRO filings added unrebutted facts before hearing.
Action Step: Document the necessity of each filing to preempt vexatious claims.
Visual: Neat stacks of labeled files vs. messy pile — “Purpose Turns Volume Into Precision.”

Module 12 – Refiling ≠ Redundancy
Core Message: Refiling can cure defects or preserve rights when initial filings are ignored.
Key Rules:
	•	“Without prejudice” means you can refile.
	•	Fix the issue before refiling.
	•	Refile to keep within appeal deadlines.
Example: Refiled TRO preserved injunctive relief eligibility after original sat without ruling.
Action Step: Track ruling timelines and refile if no action occurs within a critical period.
Visual: Motion stamped “Refiled” glowing with new docket number — “Second Filing, First Chance at Justice.”
