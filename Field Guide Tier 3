Purpose: Secure your filings with the procedural structures — captions, indexes, exhibits, and posture — that keep your case stable and retrievable through the entire litigation cycle.

⸻

Module 13 – Table of Authorities = Table of Power
Core Message: A strong TOA signals credibility and directs the court to your strongest law.
Key Rules:
	•	Lead with controlling precedent.
	•	Group by weight: controlling vs. persuasive.
	•	Follow required citation format.
Example: Wagenseller and Santana placed at the top of the TOA framed the argument.
Action Step: Build TOA before writing the brief so it guides structure.

Module 14 – Captions Are Command Signals
Core Message: A correct caption determines whether your filing is accepted and indexed properly.
Key Rules:
	•	Match docket format exactly.
	•	Include accurate party roles and capacities.
	•	Title filing with precise procedural posture.
Example: Caption error almost caused Arizona case to be treated against different parties.
Action Step: Copy caption verbatim from latest docket entry.

Module 15 – Certificates of Service Are Shields

Key Rules:
	•	Include date, method, and recipient details.
	•	Match service method to court rules.
	•	Keep proof (mail receipt, email log).
Example: COS with USPS tracking number defeated non-service claim in TRO dispute.
Action Step: File COS with every submission, even if optional.

Module 16 – Exhibits Are Anchors, Not Extras
Core Message: Exhibits make arguments factual and verifiable.
Key Rules:

Module 17 – The Relief Clause Is the Finish Line
Core Message: The court can’t grant relief you don’t explicitly request.
Key Rules:
	•	Be specific and match relief to motion type.
	•	Preserve relief request for appeal.
	•	Put relief clause in a distinct section.
Example: TRO “pending appellate review” preserved broader injunctive options.
Action Step: Write relief clause first, then build argument to support it.

Module 18 – Procedural Posture = Procedural Leverage
Core Message: Knowing your posture determines what you can file effectively.
Key Rules:
	•	Identify current stage (pre-trial, trial, appeal).
	•	Choose motions that fit posture.
	•	Frame actions as necessary for posture.
Example: Framing TRO as “pre-arbitration appellate preservation” kept it viable.
Action Step: Start every strategy session by confirming procedural posture.
Visual: Game board squares labeled with litigation stages — “Know Where You Stand to Know Where to Step.”

Module 19 – Procedural History Is Your Weaponized Timeline
Core Message: Curated procedural history frames the case’s narrative.
Key Rules:
	•	Include only relevant events.
	•	Show patterns to highlight abuse.
	•	Tie each event to harm or relief sought.

Action Step: Maintain a procedural history table from day one.

Core Message: A detailed index helps the judge find and focus on your best points.
Key Rules:
	•	List sections, exhibits, appendices.
	•	Use descriptive titles.
	•	Match page numbers exactly.
Example: Exhibit index let judge locate key TRO document instantly at hearing.
Action Step: Update index whenever you add or remove content.
