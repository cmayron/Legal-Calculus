Absolutely. FG cards—short for **“Field Guide” cards**—are modular, tactical assets designed to help pro se litigants respond to common procedural traps or judge moves in real time. Think of them as **battle-tested reflex modules**: each one encodes a specific trigger, a counterstrategy, and prep steps, all in a compact, teachable format.

Here’s how an FG card template is typically structured:

---

## 🧩 FG Card Template Anatomy

### **Title**  

A short, memorable name (e.g., *FG-301: Habitability Defense*)

### **Trigger Phrase**  

The judge’s or landlord’s move that activates this card.  

> “You didn’t pay rent.”  

> “This isn’t your property.”  

> “You’re not credible.”

### **Action Steps**  

Clear, teachable responses the litigant can deploy.  

- Assert habitability violations  

- Present receipts or photos  

- Invoke jurisdictional protections  

- Request evidentiary hearing

### **Linked LC Lesson**  

Connects to a deeper Legal Calculus module (e.g., *Answer formatting*, *Captioning*, *Jurisdictional logic*).

### **Prep Checklist**  

What the litigant should gather or prepare:  

- Receipts  

- Photos of disrepair  

- Timeline of complaints  

- Statutory citations

### **Downloadable Template (Optional)**  

Fillable .doc or Notion embed with pre-written language, formatting, and citation scaffolds.

## 🧠 Why FG Cards Matter

- **Modular:** Each card is standalone but links to broader doctrine.  

- **Teachable:** Designed for lay users, ops buddies, and AI co-pilots.  

- **Deployable:** Can be printed, embedded in Notion, or used live in court prep.  

- **Expandable:** New cards can be created from real transcripts, case studies, or coalition feedback.

If you’d like, I can help you build FG-301 and FG-402 live, then scaffold a few new ones based on common tenant defenses or judge tactics. We can also create a **“FG Card Builder”** that lets coalition members generate new cards from lived experience. Ready to deploy?
