1) Headline & Blurbs (press‑ready)

Headline (7–12 words)
A masterclass in asymmetric strategy for pro se justice.

Elevator (≤25 words)
A strategic survival guide for pro se litigants that turns filings, silence, and denials into a durable record. The archive becomes the remedy.

Short (≈50 words)
Legal Calculus is not a law hornbook—it’s a field manual. It reframes setbacks as fuel for appeal, converts silence into evidence, and treats the archive as the true court. Each card offers a core message, assignment, and model response to help pro se litigants build an unassailable record.

Medium (≈100 words)
The Legal Calculus Field Guide is a modular, repeatable system for people litigating without counsel. It converts demoralizing moments—silence, delay, denial—into strategic assets that strengthen the record. Through 1,000 micro‑modules, each with a core message, assignment, and model response, users learn to file deliberately, preserve evidence of suppression, and write for both today’s judge and tomorrow’s appeal. Its core thesis—the record is the remedy—shifts focus from winning every motion to building an archive that endures. Pair it with local rules and substantive law, and it becomes a disciplined way to survive the process while preparing for appellate review.

Dust‑jacket (≈170–200 words)
This is not a treatise. It’s a pragmatic operating system for asymmetric advocacy. The Legal Calculus Field Guide teaches pro se litigants to control what they can—filings, format, and documentation—and to convert what they can’t—silence, delay, denial—into evidence. The method is simple and powerful: every card follows the same six‑part structure (Core Message, Lesson, Assignment, Model Response, Reflection, Visual Concept), creating a rhythm that reduces overwhelm and builds skill through repetition. Its central reframes—Filing = Existence, Silence = Evidence, Denial = Recognition, Archive = True Court—align day‑to‑day actions with a long‑term goal: a clean, comprehensive, appeal‑ready record. The 20‑volume arc moves from survival to sovereignty, showing how to document suppression without losing composure, how to preserve issues for review, and how to keep momentum when the system stalls. Use it alongside procedural rules and substantive law; it won’t brief your case for you, but it will teach you to build the record that carries your case forward.

3) Landing‑Page Module (Notion/Substack ready)

Title: Legal Calculus Field Guide — What It Is
Tagline: A strategic manual for pro se litigants: build the record that outlasts the ruling.
You’ll learn to:
	•	Turn filings into memory (Filing = Existence).
	•	Treat silence as evidence and preserve it.
	•	Read denials as steps toward appeal.
	•	Organize everything into an archive that becomes your strongest witness.
Start here: FG‑001 to FG‑010 (Foundations).
Use with: Your jurisdiction’s rules + your substantive law.
Note: Educational strategy, not legal advice.

⸻

4) How to Use the Field Guide (practical workflow)
	1.	Pair with rules: Keep local rules, service rules, and deadlines open alongside the Guide.
	2.	Work the card: Read Core Message → Assignment → Model Response; draft your filing immediately.
	3.	Name the silence: Calendar expected responses. If none, document it (timeline entry + exhibit).
	4.	Index the record: Maintain an exhibit index and chronology. Update after every filing or court action.
	5.	Write for review: Preserve issues, cite where needed, and keep a neutral tone.

5) Tone Calibration (judge‑facing language)

When drafting for courts, translate high‑energy framing into neutral legal prose:
	•	“Weaponize silence” → “Preserve non‑responses as part of the record.”
	•	“Asymmetric strategy” → “Resource‑conscious documentation strategy.”
	•	“Systemic suppression” → “Procedural irregularities reflected in the record.”
	•	“Insurgency with paper” → “Diligent, rule‑compliant filing practice.”

6) FAQ (micro‑answers)

Is this a law book? No. It’s a strategic overlay. Use it with your jurisdiction’s rules and the controlling law for your claims.
Will it write my briefs? It supplies structure, assignments, and sample language—you supply facts and law.
What if the judge is hostile? Stay neutral, follow rules, and build the archive. Today’s tone should anticipate tomorrow’s appellate reader.
Can lawyers use it? Yes—many cards double as checklists for preserving issues and building appellate posture.

7) Volume Framing — Archive Across Lenses
	•	Archive = Foundation (Vol. 1): start the record; define the problem in filings.
	•	Archive = Black Box (Vol. 2): capture everything, even silence; nothing is lost.
	•	Archive = Illumination (Vol. 3): organize and cross‑reference; make patterns visible.
	•	Archive = Volcano (Vol. 8): pressure builds; release through targeted motions.
	•	Archive = Sovereign Memory (Vol. 20): the body of record stands beyond a single case.
