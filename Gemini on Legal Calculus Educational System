Gemini on Legal Calculus educational system 

Based on the images you provided, here's a summary of the "Legal Calculus" system.

The system is a legal methodology called Legal Calculus, which is organized into two distinct guides designed for different purposes: immediate action and in-depth learning.

Field Guide: Quick Reference for Action

The Field Guide is designed for speed and practical application in real-time legal situations. Think of it as a "what to do right now" manual. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

 * Purpose: A survival tool for immediate use in filings, hearings, and appeals.

 * Content: It consists of 1,000 "micro-modules" presented as checklist entries and step-by-step tasks.

 * Format: It uses plain language for quick look-ups and is portable, available as PDFs or on platforms like Google Classroom.

Master Field Guide: The Complete System

The Master Field Guide is the comprehensive, archival version of the entire system, intended for teaching, study, and preservation. It's the full, unabridged "Legal Calculus." üìö

 * Purpose: To serve as a complete, teaching-ready reference and archive.

 * Content: It includes the complete curriculum of 119 modules (LC Modules) with visuals, reflections, social commentary, and assignments.

 * Format: It's a published compendium deployed on platforms like Substack, Notion, and GitHub.

How They Relate

The pyramid diagram shows the relationship between the components. The core LC Modules (1-119) form the teaching curriculum. The Field Guide distills this curriculum into 1,000 practical micro-modules for field deployment. The Master Field Guide then compiles the core curriculum with additional materials to create the ultimate archival reference.

In short, the two guides serve one purpose from two angles: the Field Guide is for action, while the Master Guide is for preservation and teaching.
