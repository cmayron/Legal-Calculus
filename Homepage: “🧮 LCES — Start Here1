Database 3 —

Pro Se Emergency Box

(fast routes)

Make a template page for each emergency. Examples:

SOL Preservation (Clerk Return / NPT)

Goal: lock filing date to first receipt (pre-SOL).

Steps (checklist): Timeline page → Evidence pack (RRR, pre-SOL stamps, deposit stamp) → Short NPT motion → Do Not Return Without Court Order notice → Proposed minute entry.

Paste Block: “Emergency NPT helper” (below).

Attachments: your PDFs (Packets 1–3, Timeline, Master Index).

TRO/PI Starter (Winter)

Service of Process Clock (90 days)

Clerk Ping-Pong Cure (paper vs e-file)

Database 4 —

JC / LCa Caveats

Short, teachable pages:

“Judicial Efficiency ≠ Justice” — why ministerial returns ≠ SOL reset; how to ask for minute entries instead of returns.

“Paper Filer Disparity” — itemized portal rejections vs wholesale paper returns; request leave to e-file.

“Arbitration Trap Map” — how corporate defendants use cost/venue to wear you down + counter-moves.

“Class-of-One” Equal-Protection Exposure — when paper-only treatment becomes arbitrary.

Each page includes a “Paste to ChatGPT” instruction so the model can warn users in real time.

Database 5 —

Educator Track (LCA / FGA)

LCA Modules (advanced theory, case studies, doctrine stacks).

FGA Cards (1000-card deep practice).

Teaching packs: slide links, assignments, rubrics, SCORM/xAPI files.

Database 6 —

Second-Opinion Run

Create a page with the 8-step loop (your “Legal Second-Opinion Run”):

Issue → 2. Facts → 3. Rule/Standard → 4. Procedure/Timing →

Relief Sought → 6. Evidence/Exhibits → 7. Formatting/Service → 8. Risk Check (JC/LCa caveats)
