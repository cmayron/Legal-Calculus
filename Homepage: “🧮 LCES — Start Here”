# **Database 1 —**

# **LC Modules**

# **(1–119)**

Properties (create these columns):

- Number (e.g., 14)
- Title (text)
- Tier (select: Foundations / Lawfare Resistance / Sovereignty / Memory / Futures / etc.)
- Core Message (text)
- Lesson (rich text)
- Assignment (rich text)
- Model Answer (rich text)
- Visual/Asset (file)
- ChatGPT Paste Block (rich text; see universal prompt below)
- Tags (multi-select: Procedure, Evidence, Service, Relief, SOL, Clerk, NPT, etc.)
- Version (e.g., 4.5)
- Updated (date)
- Hash (text, optional)

# Tip: include a “Mini” subpage in each module (“Micro-Module”) with a 1–2 paragraph quick-teach + a 5-line checklist. That’s what users will paste into ChatGPT during emergencies.

# **Database 2 —**

# **FG Field Guide Cards**

# **(FG 001–1000)**

Properties:

- ID (e.g., FG-172)
- Card Title
- Core (1–2 lines)
- Checklist (bulleted)
- Example (short)
- Paste Block (see below)
- Tags (e.g., TRO, Filing Hygiene, NPT, SOL, Arbitration, Clerk)
- Track (select: Emergency / Planning / Evidence / Service / Appeals)

# **Database 3 —**

# **Pro Se Emergency Box**

# **(fast routes)**

Make a template page for each emergency. Examples:

1. SOL Preservation (Clerk Return / NPT)
    - Goal: lock filing date to first receipt (pre-SOL).
    - Steps (checklist): Timeline page → Evidence pack (RRR, pre-SOL stamps, deposit stamp) → Short NPT motion → Do Not Return Without Court Order notice → Proposed minute entry.
    - Paste Block: “Emergency NPT helper” (below).
    - Attachments: your PDFs (Packets 1–3, Timeline, Master Index).
2. 
3. TRO/PI Starter (Winter)
4. Service of Process Clock (90 days)
5. Clerk Ping-Pong Cure (paper vs e-file)

# **Database 4 —**

# **JC / LCa Caveats**

Short, teachable pages:

- “Judicial Efficiency ≠ Justice” — why ministerial returns ≠ SOL reset; how to ask for minute entries instead of returns.
- “Paper Filer Disparity” — itemized portal rejections vs wholesale paper returns; request leave to e-file.
- “Arbitration Trap Map” — how corporate defendants use cost/venue to wear you down + counter-moves.
- “Class-of-One” Equal-Protection Exposure — when paper-only treatment becomes arbitrary.

Each page includes a “Paste to ChatGPT” instruction so the model can warn users in real time.

# **Database 5 —**

# **Educator Track (LCA / FGA)**

- LCA Modules (advanced theory, case studies, doctrine stacks).
- FGA Cards (1000-card deep practice).
- Teaching packs: slide links, assignments, rubrics, SCORM/xAPI files.

# **Database 6 —**

# **Second-Opinion Run**

Create a page with the 8-step loop (your “Legal Second-Opinion Run”):

1. Issue → 2. Facts → 3. Rule/Standard → 4. Procedure/Timing →
2. Relief Sought → 6. Evidence/Exhibits → 7. Formatting/Service → 8. Risk Check (JC/LCa caveats)

Add a single paste block for ChatGPT (below) that takes that structure and returns a clean, actionable plan.

# **Universal “Paste to ChatGPT” blocks**

# **A) Loader**

You are my LCES assistant. I will paste LC modules, FG cards, and JC/LCa caveats from Notion.
Your job:

1. Build a mini-index from what I paste (titles + IDs).
2. When I say my goal (e.g., “preserve SOL”), map it to the best LC modules, FG cards, and caveats.
3. Give me a 10-step action plan that is procedural and safe (timing, service, exhibits, proposed orders).
4. Flag JC/LCa risk points (e.g., clerk ping-pong, paper disparity) and show cures.
5. Return a short filing checklist and a 90-day service calendar tickler.
Keep responses concise and actionable. If I paste exhibits, generate a one-page index I can drop in a brief.

**B) Emergency NPT helper (for SOL Preservation page)**

Goal: preserve the statute date via constructive filing.
Here are my facts and exhibits (RRR date, pre-SOL received stamps, check “FOR DEPOSIT ONLY” stamp, clerk return notices).
Tasks for you:

- Draft a 2-page Motion to Accept Filing Nunc Pro Tunc (bulleted facts + short law).
- Draft a 1-page Notice of Constructive Denial.
- Draft a 1-page [Proposed] Minute Entry ordering NPT to the earliest pre-SOL stamp and requiring itemized deficiency notices (no wholesale returns); grant leave to e-file.
- Output a one-page Exhibit Index and a one-page Timeline.
Return everything ready to copy/paste.

**C) Second-Opinion template (any issue)**

I’ll paste: ISSUE, FACTS, RULE/STD, PROCEDURE/TIMING, RELIEF, EVIDENCE, FORMAT/SERVICE, RISKS (JC/LCa).
Create:

- A clean plan (≤12 steps) with deadlines.
- Exhibit list w/ filenames.
- One paragraph of “what could go wrong and how to fix it.”
- A final 5-line “before you file” hygiene check.

# 

# **🚨 Pro Se Emergency**

- Banner: “When in doubt: fix the timeline, fix the service, fix the format.”
- Quick actions:
    - “Paste Emergency NPT helper into ChatGPT”
    - “Upload exhibits (PDFs) → Generate Index + Timeline”
    - “Copy Proposed Minute Entry → send to Presiding Civil JA + Clerk GC”
- 
- Buddy tip: add a small note: “Ask a trusted friend to glance at your packet before mailing—fresh eyes catch missing stamps/envelopes.” (quiet community support)

# **⚖️ JC / LCa — Paper Filer Disparity**

- Core: Electronic filers get itemized portal errors; paper filers get wholesale returns. Cure: ask for minute entry and leave to e-file.
- Checklist: NPT ask • Don’t-return-without-order ask • SASE on top • Single category checked on CV10f • Proposed minute entry included.

# **📚 Educator On-Ramp (LCA/FGA)**

- Use case: clinics, classes, CLE.
- Pack: 10 LC modules + 30 FG cards + 5 JC caveats; assignments + model answers.
- Call to action: “Copy ‘Loader’ prompt and paste 3–5 cards to start in class.”

# **Case study page you can publish now**

Title: Case Study — SOL Preservation vs. Clerk Returns (Maricopa)

Intro (2–3 lines): A live example of constructive filing with pre-SOL receipts and post-SOL ping-pong.

Attachments:

- Master_Exhibit_Index_SOL_Binder.pdf
- SOL_Timeline_OnePager.pdf
- Maricopa_Return_2025-09-17_Packet1of2.pdf
- Maricopa_SOL_Proof_Packet2of2.pdf
- Maricopa_SOL_Proof_Packet3of3.pdf
Teaching notes: Where JC/LCa dynamics showed up; how the Proposed Minute Entry solves the “paper-only” disadvantage.
Paste Block: Emergency NPT helper.

# **Tag taxonomy (keep it simple)**

- Domain: Employment/Retaliation, Licensing, Records, Arbitration, §1983
- Procedure: Filing, Service, SOL, NPT, TRO/PI, Appeal, Special Action
- Venue: Maricopa, SDNY, NDNY, D. Ariz, etc.
- Risk (JC/LCa): Paper Disparity, Portal vs Counter, Clerk Overreach, Judicial Efficiency, Arbitration Trap

# **“How to paste into ChatGPT” (add this as a Notion subpage)**

1. Copy the Loader.
2. Paste 1–3 Micro-Modules or FG cards relevant to your problem.
3. Paste the Emergency helper (if urgent).
4. Paste your facts/exhibits (or links to your PDFs) and say: “Generate the filing plan + index.”
5. Ask for a 5-line hygiene check before you mail or e-file.

# **Subtle but important: community + wellness**

- Add a tiny “Buddy Box” callout on emergency pages: “Ask one friend to be your second set of eyes. Ten minutes can save ten days.”
- If you ever want it, add a resource footnote: “Short-term counseling for litigation stress—ask for ‘brief, skills-focused support.’” (just an option; not a directive)
