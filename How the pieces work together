Love this question. Here’s the clean, no-nonsense way the pieces fit — and why the app matters even if you have GPT-5 Thinking on tap.

How the pieces work together

LC = Legal Calculus (teaching modules) — the “why” and “when,” doctrine & strategy.

LCa = Lawyer Calculus — how opposing (and your own) counsel behave; risk-aversion, “don’t upset the judge,” counters.

FG = Field Guide cards — 1-page “do this now” playbooks (Use-case → Signal → Actions → Copy block → Evidence → Escalation).

FGA = Field Guide Assignments — quick drills to lock muscle memory; self-check so you don’t miss a step under pressure.

The process (two modes)

1) Crisis Mode (5-minute triage)

Open FG → search your situation (e.g., “status,” “mailbox,” “TRO,” “mementos”).

Run the card → follow the 3–7 actions; tap the Language Block; Export PDF/Word.

Preserve → add receipts/hash appendix (FG-671/FG-673).

Counter behavior → if you hit stonewalling or “don’t upset the judge” talk, jump to LCa (e.g., FG-339/340/342) and send the ready script.

2) Deep Mode (build power)

Read LC module that matches your situation (the “why/when”).

Do the FGA drill (the “can I actually do it right?”).

Return to FG to execute with speed and fewer mistakes.

Think cockpit: LC = ground school, FG = the laminated checklist, LCa = ATC/traffic maneuvers, FGA = sims.

Why use the

app

instead of “just ask GPT-5 Thinking”?

Speed under stress. The app gives you the answer format, not a conversation. One tap → exact language block → export.

Consistency & defensibility. Cards are pre-vetted and fixed; you get the same steps every time (great for exhibits and repeat filings).

Offline + private. Works without network; no chat history to leak.

Fewer unforced errors. Checklists prevent “oops, forgot Rule 65(b) notice” or “left out tracking proof.”

Evidence packaging built-in. Cards point you to receipts, hashes, and escalation clocks you’ll need in court.

Training effect. FGA drills make you faster and calmer; you become less dependent on a live back-and-forth.

When to still use GPT-5 Thinking (it’s a

both/and

)

Customize to facts (turn the 120-word block into a tailored 2-page letter/motion).

Localize law (jurisdiction citations, case law).

Brainstorm strategy (choose among multiple lawful paths).

Polish long memos (format tables, timelines, visuals). The app is your baseline and guardrails; GPT is your co-counsel for bespoke work.

“Second open” daily loop (how a returning user runs the day)

Check status (FG-001/004) → log what moved.

Preserve (FG-667/668) → one-page status + receipts.

Plan next action with LCa (is someone stonewalling/ghosting? pick the counter card).

Deepen with the matching LC module + FGA quick drill.

Export & file → PDF/Word packet + hash mini-appendix.

Why the education/checklist matters

Because courts reward format, completeness, and timing. Checklists + drills:

cut omissions,

standardize your record,

turn silence/spin into admissible memory.
