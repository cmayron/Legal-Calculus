A simple fix: use a 0–100 LCES Injustice Score (I-Score) built from six public, objective signals:
	•	Procedural Friction: rejected filings, clerk refusals, compelled arbitration, fee-waiver denials
	•	Delay: days to docket; days to TRO decision
	•	Language Access: interpreter provided; translated core documents
	•	Outcome Disparity: relief granted vs dismissal on pure procedure
	•	Financial Burden: out-of-pocket costs, hours, arbitration fees
	•	Remedy Risk: job loss, reportable registries (e.g., NPDB), health impact

Interpretation:
	•	Low < 40 | Moderate 40–69 | Severe ≥ 70

Why it matters
	•	Turns “nebulous” injustice into actionable signals
	•	Shows where to invest (interpreters, timelines, fee policy)
	•	Enables accountability without vilifying individuals—manage the pipeline, not the people
