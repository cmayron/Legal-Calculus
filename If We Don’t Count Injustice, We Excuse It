# **If We Don’t Count Injustice, We Excuse It**

By Charles Mayron, MD

When people say “justice is hard to measure,” what they often mean is “we’re not measuring it.” Imagine a city that never counts 911 response times and then insists the system is fine because no one can prove otherwise. Courts and agencies do a version of this every day. The result is predictable: those with resources navigate the maze, while the rest learn to live with locked doors.

I built the Legal Calculus Educational System (LCES) because too many people—especially pro se litigants and those who don’t speak English at home—are told their losses are just “procedural.” The docket is late? A filing gets bounced on a technicality? Arbitration is compelled and fees land on the person who didn’t want arbitration? Sorry, rules are rules. We treat these as administrative footnotes instead of what they are: outcomes.

Here’s the uncomfortable truth: if we can measure wait times at airports and defect rates in factories, we can measure whether the justice system is functioning for ordinary people. And when we do, the fog lifts. Injustice is not an abstraction; it’s a pattern with countable signals.

# **The problem we refuse to name**

Injustice rarely announces itself as a dramatic miscarriage. It shows up as friction: a clerk who “can’t locate” a filing, an interpreter who isn’t available, a translated form that doesn’t exist, a “come back next month,” an appeal lost to a rule that was never explained. For a represented party, friction is an annoyance absorbed by a lawyer’s office. For a pro se litigant, it’s the case.

If your first language is Spanish, the friction compounds. Without an interpreter or translated documents, you don’t just lose time—you lose footing. The hearing you couldn’t understand becomes the decision you can’t appeal, followed by the job you can’t keep. That’s not a language problem. It’s a justice problem.

# **A simple way to start counting**

We don’t need a ten-year study. We need a habit. The LCES “Judicial Calculus” proposes an Injustice Score (I-Score)—a 0–100 composite that any court or watchdog can compute from public facts, no legal theory required. It tracks six practical subscores:

- Procedural friction (rejections, clerk refusals, compelled arbitration, fee-waiver denials)
- Delay (days to a docket number; days to a TRO decision)
- Language access (interpreter provided; documents translated)
- Outcome disparity (relief granted vs. dismissal on pure procedure)
- Financial burden (out-of-pocket costs, hours consumed, arbitration fees)
- Remedy risk (job loss, reportable registries like the NPDB, health impact)

Each case gets a number and a bucket: Low (<40), Moderate (40–69), Severe (≥70). Then the population-level picture becomes impossible to ignore: What percentage of cases in this courthouse land in “Severe”? How big is the gap between people who needed language services and those who didn’t? Is injustice rare—or routine?

This is not perfect, and it doesn’t need to be. Perfection has been the system’s favorite excuse for doing nothing.

# **What counting will change**

First, honesty. If a jurisdiction publishes a monthly “Justice Dashboard” showing, for example, that 32% of pro se employment disputes score Severe, that’s a public mandate to fix the process—no op-eds required.

Second, priorities. Numbers tell you where to invest. If interpreter access is the strongest driver, fund it. If timeline slippage is the culprit, set service-level targets (seven days to a docket number; fourteen to a TRO decision absent extraordinary circumstances) and post your performance.

Third, accountability without blame. A rising I-Score is a system signal. It doesn’t brand a judge or a clerk as a villain. It says: “this part of the pipeline is failing the people we serve.” That’s the beginning of real management.

Fourth, a reality check on arbitration. When courts compel arbitration, the I-Score captures the cost shift and the practical effect on access. If compelled arbitration reliably pushes vulnerable parties into “Severe,” it’s time to revisit who pays, how timelines are enforced, and whether forced arbitration is compatible with equal justice.

# **“But justice is special—can you really quantify it?”**

We already do. Sentencing guidelines, damages caps, fee schedules, filing deadlines—all numbers, all norms. The only thing we’ve refused to quantify is the lived cost of process for the people least able to absorb it.

And no, an index won’t replace judicial judgment. It will inform it—just as hospital mortality dashboards don’t replace physicians but make them better. If you think justice is too sacred to measure, ask yourself why we measure everything else that matters.

# **A Spanish-speaking test for our conscience**

If you want a single litmus test for whether safety nets are sufficient, try this: Does a Spanish-speaking litigant with a valid claim, no lawyer, and no interpreter have a fair path to relief? If your jurisdiction can’t show, with data, that the answer is yes most of the time, then it isn’t. The fix is not mysterious—provide interpreters as a right, translate core forms, and train staff. Count it and publish it.

# **What courts and cities can do tomorrow**

1. Publish a monthly Justice Dashboard. Start with four dials: Severe% (I-Score ≥ 70), average days to docket, interpreter coverage, and fee-waiver approval rates.
2. Set service targets and keep them. Seven days to a docket number; fourteen to a TRO decision—then show your compliance.
3. Guarantee language access. Interpreters and translated forms for the top five languages in your jurisdiction, no exceptions.
4. Audit arbitration impacts. If arbitration is compelled, track who pays and whether timelines and remedies match court realities.
5. Fund help early, not late. Modest navigator programs and filing clinics at the front end are cheaper—and more just—than appeals after the damage is done.

# **Stop waiting for the perfect study**

The longer we call injustice “nebulous,” the longer we license it. The Judicial Calculus is not a final verdict; it’s a flashlight. If the beam lands on language access, fix language access. If it lands on delay, fix delay. If it lands on arbitration, re-balance the costs you shifted.

What gets measured gets managed. We owe the public at least that much—especially those whose first encounter with the justice system should not also be their last.

Author’s note: The LCES I-Score is open and free for any court, clinic, newsroom, or watchdog to use. Start counting. Then start improving.
