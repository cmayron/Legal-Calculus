If We Don’t Count Injustice, We Excuse It

Justice isn’t “too special” to measure—we just haven’t been measuring it. When courts don’t track basics like days to a docket number, interpreter availability, or how often filings get bounced, friction becomes fate—especially for pro se and Spanish-speaking litigants.

A simple fix: use a 0–100 LCES Injustice Score (I-Score) built from six public, objective signals:
	•	Procedural Friction: rejected filings, clerk refusals, compelled arbitration, fee-waiver denials
	•	Delay: days to docket; days to TRO decision
	•	Language Access: interpreter provided; translated core documents
	•	Outcome Disparity: relief granted vs dismissal on pure procedure
	•	Financial Burden: out-of-pocket costs, hours, arbitration fees
	•	Remedy Risk: job loss, reportable registries (e.g., NPDB), health impact

Interpretation:
	•	Low < 40 | Moderate 40–69 | Severe ≥ 70

Why it matters
	•	Turns “nebulous” injustice into actionable signals
	•	Shows where to invest (interpreters, timelines, fee policy)
	•	Enables accountability without vilifying individuals—manage the pipeline, not the people

Do this tomorrow
	1.	Publish a monthly Justice Dashboard: Severe%, avg. days to docket, interpreter coverage, fee-waiver approval rate
	2.	Set service targets: docket ≤ 7 days; TRO ≤ 14 days (absent extraordinary cause) and report compliance
	3.	Guarantee language access—interpreters + translated core forms for top local languages
	4.	Audit arbitration impacts: who pays, time to decision, remedy comparability vs court
	5.	Fund early help (navigators/filing clinics) instead of late appeals

A plain test for safety-net sufficiency: Can a Spanish-speaking pro se litigant with a meritorious claim reach relief most of the time? If you can’t show “yes” with data, the answer is no. Start counting—then start improving.
