Module 11 – Service Is Jurisdiction 📬🧾
⚖️ Core Message
If service isn’t perfected — and provable — the court may lack power to act on your papers. Service creates obligation, starts clocks, and anchors due process. Prove it in the record.

📖 Lesson Content
• Service as Trigger 🎯 — Proper service (FRCP 4/5 or state equivalent) starts response deadlines.
• Service as Proof 📸 — File a COS and attach receipts/affidavits/logs.
• Service as Strategy 🧠 — Choose fast, dispute‑resistant methods; stipulate to email; update addresses.
📝 Assignment
Draft a Certificate of Service that lists document, date/time, recipients/addresses, method + tracking, signature. Add an exhibit list for proof.

✅ Model Answer (Example)
CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE

I hereby certify that on August 25, 2025, I served a true and correct copy of the foregoing [Motion] on [names/addresses] via Certified Mail and by stipulated email.

/s/ [Your Name]

💡 Reflection
Service is the infrastructure of due process. Clean proof controls the clock and closes off evasions.

Module 12 – Abstention ≠ Immunity 🛑🛡️
⚖️ Core Message
Abstention is narrow. Do Sprint first; then exceptions: bad faith/harassment, extraordinary circumstances, or inadequate forum.

📖 Lesson Content
• Sprint scope 🎯 — criminal, quasi‑criminal enforcement, or judicial‑function civil proceedings only.
• Exceptions 🔥 — bad faith, irreparable injury, no adequate forum.
• Relief 🧰 — tailor; use Ex parte Young; avoid intruding on state judgment.
📝 Assignment
Draft an Opposition to Stay: (1) Sprint analysis; (2) Adequate forum deficiency; (3) Exceptions with facts; (4) Tailored relief.

✅ Model Answer (Example)
OPPOSITION TO STAY (YOUNGER)

Younger doesn’t apply; alternatively exceptions apply. Deny stay or narrow it; set expedited schedule.

/s/ [Your Name]

💡 Reflection
Abstention is a scalpel, not a sledgehammer. Force on‑record analysis.

Module 13 – Ex parte Young — Prospective Relief Against Officials 🏛️⚖️
⚖️ Core Message
Sovereign immunity does not bar prospective federal relief against officials with enforcement connection.

📖 Lesson Content
• Proper defendant 🎯 — special relation to enforcement.
• Limits 🚫 — no state‑law orders (Pennhurst), no retroactive damages (Edelman), ‘person’ limits (Will).
• Ask narrowly 🪡 — prospective injunction/declaration only.
📝 Assignment
Draft a brief section in your TRO/PI: identify official, ongoing federal violation, prospective relief only, why Pennhurst/Will don’t bar.

Module 14 – Injunctions Require Four Factors (Winter) ❄️⚖️
⚖️ Core Message

• Harm 🚑 — immediate, non‑compensable; declarations/exhibits.

✅ Model Answer (Example)
MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

Module 15 – TROs Require Notice or Certification (FRCP 65(b)) 🛎️📑
⚖️ Core Message
If ex parte, certify notice efforts and why notice risks irreparable harm; set prompt PI hearing and address bond.

📖 Lesson Content
• Notice vs. ex parte 📣 — certification required if ex parte.
• Specificity & duration ⏱️ — 14‑day TRO; set PI hearing.
• Security 💳 — argue minimal/none if appropriate.
📝 Assignment
