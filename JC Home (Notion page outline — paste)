Sections

- Situational Cards (live advice)
    - Service defect ambush
        - What it really means: judge wants an off-ramp.
        - What you say (one bite): “Extend Rule 4(m), deem-timely upon proofs, then decide the PI.”
        - Proof to gather: USPS tracking (Ex. C), PS-3800/3811, FedEx POD (Ex. D).
        - Follow-up ask: “Rule 52(a)(2) findings; if deferring, decide within 3 business days after proofs.”
    - 
    - Younger abstention play
        - Tell the rule (once): Diamond “D” at 199 — “retaliatory/harassing/illegitimate motive.”
        - Apply facts fast: post-speech pivot → misattribution after notice → compelled exam/releases.
        - Relief: status-quo only (no §230(7) exam; no blanket releases).
    - 
    - Futility/leave detour
        - Move: “FAC is operative under Rule 15(a)(1); ‘leave’ was courtesy; futility is moot.”
        - If needed: nunc pro tunc + issue summons + brief 4(m) extension.
    - 
    - No TRO / docket silence
        - Hook: administrative stay (status-quo) + 4(m) deem-timely + commit to decide PI on submission when proofs file.
    - 
    - “Vexatious/serial” label
        - Counter: one-bite filing; everything in the Reply; no side letters.
    - 
- 
- Tone & Scripts
    - Email to AAG (actual notice): send tracking + PDFs, one line in Reply documenting it.
    - Hearing micro-script (30/60/90 sec).
    - Tone guard: use misattributed/inauthentic, not “fabricated,” unless you can prove it; cite exhibits (G–J).
- 
- Micro-Orders (copy)
    - Defer-then-decide order: status-quo; 4(m) extended + deem-timely; PI decided on submission within 3 days post-proof.
    - Admin stay: status-quo only until PI decision.
- 
- Appeal-proofing
    - Rule 52(a)(2) written findings request.
    - Dates inside the sentence (timeline parentheticals).
    - Distinguish statutory vs courtesy service in captions.
- 

# tiny human boost card: schedule a 10-minute friend/therapist check-in around filings — calmer you, better record.

# **FG —**

# **LC how-to**

# **(recipes, checklists, copy blocks)**

Goal: give the “do this / then that” steps, exhibits, and language — zero guesswork.
