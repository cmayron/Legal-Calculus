# **JC — Judicial Calculus (Off-Ramp Blockers)**

**JC-301 — One-Bite Filing Discipline**

Teach:

- Put everything in the Reply: service cure (4(m) + 4(l)(3)), Rule 15(a)(1) timeline, Ex parte Young, Younger bad-faith, Mathews, Winter, Rule 52, defer-then-decide, proposed order text.
- Avoid serial letters that invite “vexatious” labels.

**JC-302 — Rule 15(a)(1) Timeline + “Futility Is Moot”**

Teach:

- If within 21 days of a Rule 12(b) motion → FAC operative as of right. “Leave” motion can be courtesy only.
Drop-in:

# Operative Pleading (Rule 15(a)(1)): FAC filed [date], within 21 days of Rule 12(b) served [date]; leave was courtesy. Futility is moot and not a basis to deny/delay the PI.

**JC-303 — Younger (Second Circuit:**

**Diamond “D”**

**at 199)**

Teach:

- Quote the rule once: “retaliatory, harassing, or other illegitimate motive.”
- Fact map: post-speech pivot, misattribution after notice, compelled exam/blanket releases.
Drop-in:

# This record shows exactly that motive; abstention off-ramp is closed.

**JC-304 — Defer-Then-Decide + Rule 52(a)(2) (Appeal-Proofing)**

Teach:

- When proofs are imminent, ask to defer until proofs file, then decide on submission within 3 business days—with Rule 52 findings on Winter.
Proposed micro-order:
1. Status-quo only (no exam/no releases).
2. 4(m) extended; service deemed timely upon proofs.
3. PI decided on submission within 3 days post-proofs.

**JC-305 — “What Prejudice?” + Pro Se Solicitude**

Teach:

- Frame no prejudice + Rule 1 (economy) + pro se solicitude (Haines/Triestman/LeSane).
Drop-in:

# Defendants identify no prejudice; they litigated on full notice. A short 4(m) deem-timely order conserves resources and avoids duplicate filings.

**JC-306 — Tone & Evidence: Misattribution Without Accusation**

Teach:

- Use “misattributed/inauthentic”, not “fabricated,” unless you can prove it; anchor with Ex. G–J and the notice date to counsel.
- Neutral declaration format for each exhibit.

# **Templates & Snippets (Notion Paragraph Library)**

Service (§ II.A):

# USPS Certified (RRR) No. [ARTICLE] mailed [DATE]; PS-3811 requested. USPS Express [EI####] — [Delivered/Scheduled] [DATE, TIME] (Ex. C). Rule 4(l)(3) permits proof to follow.

# Operative Pleading (Rule 15(a)(1)): FAC filed [date], within 21 days of Rule 12(b) served [date]; leave was courtesy. Futility is moot.

# Less-drastic alternative: brief 4(m) extension, deem-timely on proofs, decide the PI (Rule 1).

Bad-Faith (Younger):

# Proceedings “animated by a retaliatory, harassing, or other illegitimate motive.” Diamond “D”, 282 F.3d at 199. Facts: post-speech pivot, misattribution after notice, compelled exam/releases.

Mathews lead:

# Pre-deprivation timing matters. Mathews favors relief: private interest (license/NPDB), risk of error (paper-only + misattribution after notice), minimal burden (status-quo pause). DiBlasio, 344 F.3d 292.

Defer/Decide + Rule 52:

# If service proof is imminent, defer; then decide on submission in 3 business days with Rule 52(a)(2) findings on Winter.

Pro se solicitude:

# Haines, 404 U.S. at 520–21; Triestman, 470 F.3d at 474; LeSane, 239 F.3d at 209.
