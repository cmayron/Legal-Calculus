# **Key Difference Between LC and LCA**

- LC = streamlined teaching modules (1–119). Short, clear, classroom-ready.
- LCA = advanced commentary set (also 1–119). Adds:
    - deeper doctrinal ties,
    - reflections and analogies,
    - case law references,
    - cross-links to other modules,
    - extended assignments for mastery.
