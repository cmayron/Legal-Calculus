LC (Legal Calculus) vs LCA (Legal Calculus Advanced).

Think of it as the same relationship FG ↔ FGA, but at the module level rather than the field guide level.

# **Example with**

# **Module 1**

**📘 LC-1 —**

**Filing = Protest**

Core Message: Filing is protest. It takes your grievance out of silence and forces it into record.

Lesson Content (concise):

- Filing creates official memory.
- Without filing, there is no case.
- Courts only act on record, not on conversation.

Assignment: Write a one-line statement of protest through filing.

Model Answer: “I protest by placing this grievance in the record.”

**📗 LCA-1 —**

**Filing = Protest**

**(Advanced)**

Core Message: Filing is protest.

Expanded Teaching:

- Filing is more than compliance; it is dissent in formal shape.
- The clerk’s stamp transforms your personal grievance into institutional memory.
- Procedural obstruction (e.g., refusal to docket) is not neutral — it’s suppression.
- Every filing builds not only your case, but the collective record of how institutions treat pro se litigants.

Case Law / Doctrinal Link:

- Christopher v. Harbury — denial of court access.
- Mathews v. Eldridge — due process as structured sequence.

Cross-Module References:

- LC-14 (Winter Factors for TROs) — how protest becomes emergency relief.
- LC-31 (Archive is the Appeal) — why preservation matters even when denied.

Reflection Prompt:

- How does filing resemble protest movements outside law (marches, petitions, medical charting, publication)?
- What would happen if no one filed?

Assignment:

1. Draft a one-line protest.
2. Explain how filing preserves future appellate posture.

Model Answer:

- “I protest by placing this grievance in the record. This filing preserves my right to appeal, even if ignored today.”

# **Key Difference Between LC and LCA**

- LC = streamlined teaching modules (1–119). Short, clear, classroom-ready.
- LCA = advanced commentary set (also 1–119). Adds:
    - deeper doctrinal ties,
    - reflections and analogies,
    - case law references,
    - cross-links to other modules,
    - extended assignments for mastery.
