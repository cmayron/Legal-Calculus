- C = Why · FG = How · JC = Reality.
Why (LC): “We exist for the 92% who don’t get enough legal help.” 
How (FG): “UPL-safe education + document prep. Architect → Blueprint → Builder. No advice.”
Reality (JC): “Courts see huge SRL volume in family dockets (often 60–90% with at least one self-represented party).”
- Justice gap: Low-income Americans get no or insufficient help for ~92% of serious civil problems.
- SRL prevalence: Many family courts report majority SRL participation (60–90% with at least one SRL, depending on jurisdiction).
- Incumbent friction vs. shift: Even mainstream reports say AI is reshaping firm business models, which explains cultural resistance alongside adoption.
- Complement, not replace. “LCES educates and prepares documents; lawyers remain essential for advice and strategy.”
- UPL-safe by design. Separation of duties + compliance stress test → document prep only, not legal advice.
- Escalation path. “When advice is needed, we hand off to counsel or legal aid—clean record, clean exhibits, ready to review.”
- “Start with Orientation → Blueprint Intake → Assemble → Compliance Check (no advice).”
- “If you need advice, here are state bar lawyer-referral and court self-help links.”
