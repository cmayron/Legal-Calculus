1) Common Pitfalls & Traps — Drop■In Block
**Use this section at the end of each module.** Edit the bullets to match the module’s topic.
**Common Pitfalls & Traps**
• **Stale Parties/Service List.** Certificates or captions that don’t reflect new counsel, new parties, or capacity
(individual vs. official).
• **Undated Facts.** Assertions without dates → no chronology → weak record.
• **No Pinpoints.** Case cites without page/paragraph pinpoints; exhibit cites without page IDs.
• **Wrong Rule / Wrong Relief.** Citing the wrong rule or asking for relief the rule doesn’t authorize.
• **Overbreadth.** Requests or orders that are broader/longer than needed; courts dislike overreach.
• **Local■Rule Misses.** Page limits, font, margins, certifications (word count), meet■and■confer statements.
• **Service Method Mismatch.** Email when e■file or mail is required; forgetting to serve non■ECF parties.
• **Missing Proposed Order.** Forces the court to draft for you; raises friction.
• **COS Defects.** No date, method, or full addresses; missing signature block.
**How to Self■Audit**
• Run the **TNRPESC** pass: **T**iming, **N**arrative, **R**elief, **P**rocedure, **E**vidence, **S**ervice,
**C**itations.
• Confirm dated facts + exhibit labels on **every** assertion you rely on.

4) New Modules (120–124)
Module 120 — The “Meet and Confer”: Weaponizing Good Faith ■■
**■■ Core Message**
The meet■and■confer duty is an **opportunity** to build a record of reasonableness and expose obstruction.
**■ Lesson Content**
1) **Paper Trail First/Last.** Send a pre■call email outlining the dispute, authority, and your narrow ask; follow
with a memorializing email capturing positions and deadlines.
2) **Frame the Ask.** Tie each request to a rule/element; propose a reasonable scope (custodians, dates,
formats).
3) **Sanctions Path.** Each step should set up a future motion to compel and fees: your good faith vs. their
refusal.
**■ Assignment**
Draft the **post■call memorializing email** for RFP #7 (communications re termination), proposing a 14■day
rolling production and a privilege log within 10 days.
**■ Model Response**
“Counsel, this memorializes our [date] meet■and■confer re **RFP 7**. The request is proportional and directly
relevant. Please confirm by **Fri 5:00 PM** that you will (1) produce emails/Texts/Teams/Slack from
**08/01–09/30/2025** for custodians **Krouner/Shipley/HR**, and (2) serve a **privilege log**. Absent a
substantive response, we will move to compel and for fees.”
**■ Common Pitfalls & Traps**
• No follow■up email → no record.
• Vague asks (“all documents”) vs. scoped (dates/custodians/formats).
• Demands without authority → looks unreasonable.
**■ Reflection Summary**
You’re not persuading them; you’re **building the exhibit** the judge will read.
**■■ Visuals**
Flow: Ask → Refusal → Memorializing Email → Motion to Compel (fees).
Module 121 — Defending Your Deposition: The Record Is Your Shield ■■■
**■■ Core Message**
A deposition is not a conversation; it is **record construction**. Short, precise answers win.
**■ Lesson Content**
1) **Pause.** Two■second pause before every answer breaks control and prevents blurting.
2) **Answer Only What Was Asked.** “Yes/No/I don’t know/I don’t recall” when accurate.
3) **Document Control.** If asked about a document, ask to see it; don’t guess.
**■ Assignment**
With an ally, rehearse 10 leading questions answering only with the **Four Magic Phrases** or a short factual
sentence.
**■ Model Responses**
Q: “You sent it to cause trouble, correct?”
A: “No.”
Q: “You were angry when you wrote it?”
A: “I don’t recall my emotional state.”
**■ Common Pitfalls & Traps**
• Volunteering explanations.
• Answering hypotheticals or compound questions without clarification.
• Guessing about a document you haven’t been shown.
**■ Reflection Summary**
Defense scores when **you** talk. Make the transcript boring and precise.
**■■ Visuals**
Transcript with short, clean answers; a shield deflecting “Leading/Assumption/Speculation.”
Module 122 — Opposing Summary Judgment: Create the Factual Dispute ■■
**■■ Core Message**
You don’t have to win the case—only show a **genuine dispute of material fact**.
**■ Lesson Content**
1) **Two■Column Response.** Left: their “Undisputed Fact.” Right: “DISPUTED—Ex. A ¶4; Ex. D at 3.”
2) **Evidence, Not Rhetoric.** Declarations with dates, documents with Bates/pages, deposition pinpoints.
3) **Target Materiality.** Dispute what **matters** to the elements/defenses.
**■ Assignment**
line).
Pick one “undisputed fact” and draft a two■column rebuttal with three admissible cites (declaration, doc, depo
**■ Model Response (Excerpt)**
| Defendant’s “Undisputed” | Plaintiff’s Response |
|---|---|
| 7. Termination was solely performance■based. | **DISPUTED.** Termination occurred **10 days** after
protected report; contemporaneous review rated “meets/exceeds.” Ex. C (Report 2/20/24); Ex. D (Review
1/2024). |
**■ Common Pitfalls & Traps**
• No pinpoints; cites to whole exhibits.
• Attorney argument without admissible evidence.
• Disputing immaterial facts.
**■ Reflection Summary**
MSJ is a “put up or shut up” moment. **Put up your evidence.**
**■■ Visuals**
Two■column chart with arrows from evidence to disputed fact.
Module 123 — Pro Se at Trial: Managing Exhibits ■■■
**■■ Core Message**
Evidence exists at trial **only** if marked, shown, founded, and admitted—organization wins.
**■ Lesson Content**
1) **Three Steps to Introduce.** Mark → Show → Foundation through witness → Move to admit.
2) **Trial Binder.** Master tab for exhibits; per■witness tabs with question outlines + exhibit map.
3) **Copies x4.** You, witness, opposing, judge.
**■ Assignment**
Draft a 1■page **Exhibit & Witness Map** for your first three witnesses and the exhibits each will sponsor.
**■ Model (Excerpt)**
**Witness 1: C. Mayron**
• Ex. 1 — Email 02/20/2024. Q: “Do you recognize Ex. 1? Did you write it on that date?”
• Ex. 2 — Jan 2024 Review. Q: “Is this a true and correct copy?”
**■ Common Pitfalls & Traps**
• Skipping foundation (“What is it? How do you know?”).
• Unlabeled exhibits; no exhibit list.
• Moving to admit **before** laying foundation.
**■ Reflection Summary**
Your outline is the script; your exhibits are the props—**rehearse**.
**■■ Visuals**
Binder with tabs; a bridge of “Mark → Show → Foundation → Admitted.”
Module 124 — Judicial Complaints: The Final Accountability Lever ■■✍■
**■■ Core Message**
A judicial complaint is not an appeal. Use it **rarely**, precisely, and only for **ethical misconduct**.
**■ Lesson Content**
1) **Grounds.** Bias, improper demeanor, persistent undue delay, ex parte; **not** mere legal error.
2) **Proof■First.** Quote transcripts; cite docket entries; attach conflicting orders; avoid motive speculation.
3) **No Case Advantage.** It won’t change your case outcome; it’s a systems■accountability process.
**■ Assignment**
Identify the correct judicial council; find rules/forms; draft a 1■paragraph complaint summary with the specific
canon allegedly violated.
**■ Model Summary**
“Failure to rule on an emergency TRO for **94 days**, despite multiple written requests, shows persistent
neglect of duty in violation of **Canon 3(B)(8)** requiring prompt, efficient, and fair disposition of judicial
matters.”
**■ Common Pitfalls & Traps**
• Complaining about legal outcomes instead of misconduct.
• Speculating on motives.
• No dates, no quotes, no exhibits.
**■ Reflection Summary**
This is a slow, heavy lever. Pull it when the **record is undeniable** and the harm is institutional.
**■■ Visuals**
Code of conduct page with highlighted canon; sealed envelope addressed to the Judicial Council.
**Care & Support Note.** These fights are marathons. Consider recruiting a reliable study ally to review one
module a week with you, and book a brief check■in with a therapist or counselor during high■stress windows.
Staying connected keeps your decisions sharp and your energy sustainable.
Gemini → JC Reaction Pack (v0.1)
**Purpose.** Fold Gemini’s reaction into *Judicial Calculus (JC)* as plug■and■play counters, filings, and
evidence checklists. Keeps the language pro■se friendly and pairs every move with LC/FG anchors.
A) Synthesis
• Gatekeeping focuses: **12(b)(6)** plausibility, **jurisdiction/standing**, and **FRCP 56**.
• Discovery pressure points: **compel**, **proportionality cudgel**, **privilege log fights**.
• Healthcare context: **corporate practice of medicine**, **informed consent** patterns.
B) Issue → JC Map (fast routing)
• **12(b)(6) plausibility** → JC■19 (Plausibility Ratchet)
• **12(b)(1)/(2) jurisdiction** → JC■01/JC■02 (Subject■matter/Personal)
• **Standing** → JC■04 (Injury, causation, redressability)
• **FRCP 56 (MSJ)** → JC■34 (Cherry■Pick SJ) + JC■35 (Two■Column Dispute)
• **Compel / Sanctions path** → JC■27 (Proportionality cudgel) + JC■29 (Rule 37)
• **Privilege disputes** → JC■36 (In■camera / Black Box) + JC■37 (Privilege Log)
• **Spoliation** → JC■38 (Preservation → Adverse Inference)
• **Healthcare structural** → JC■41 (Corporate Practice of Medicine) + JC■42 (Informed Consent)
**Anchors:** Pair each JC move with LC/FG modules and **dated** exhibits.
C) Micro■Cards (drop■in)
1) 12(b)(6) — Plausibility
**Signal.** “Threadbare recitals / conclusory.”
**One■liner Counter.** “Plausibility is satisfied: each element is met by dated facts with exhibits and pinpoints;
any gap is curable → grant leave to amend.”
**Anchors.** JC■19 • LC■1, LC■3 • FG■TOA/TOC.
2) 12(b)(1)/(2) — Jurisdiction
**Signal.** “No subject■matter / no personal jurisdiction.”
**One■liner Counter.** “Subject■matter: [fed question/diversity]. Personal: purposeful availment +
forum■related contacts + reasonableness (dates, transactions, forum effects).”
**Anchors.** JC■01/02 • LC■Venue/Service • FG■Jurisdiction Map.
3) Standing
**Signal.** “No injury / not redressable.”
**One■liner Counter.** “Concrete, particularized injury caused by defendant, redressable by
[injunction/damages]; see dated payroll/licensing/discipline records.”
**Anchors.** JC■04 • LC■Relief Builder.
4) Summary Judgment
**Signal.** “No genuine dispute of material fact.”
**One■liner Counter.** “Material disputes shown via **two■column chart** with admissible cites (declaration
¶¶, exhibits with page IDs, depo lines).”
**Anchors.** JC■34/35 • LC■Evidence Map • FG■Two■Column Sheet.
5) Motion to Compel
**Signal.** “We conferred; request is overbroad.”
**One■liner Counter.** “Scoped by dates/custodians/formats; meet■and■confer emails attached; privilege log
demanded; fees under Rule 37.”
**Anchors.** JC■27/29 • LC■Discovery Builder • FGA■9.7.
6) Proportionality Cudgel
**Signal.** “Unduly burdensome.”
**One■liner Counter.** “Stage discovery; limit to top custodians/time window; cost■shift if needed; preserve
key sources.”
**Anchors.** JC■27 • LC■Scope Narrowing.
7) Privilege Log Fights
**Signal.** “Privilege (blanket).”
**One■liner Counter.** “Require log with authors/recipients/dates/descriptions; challenge over■designation;
propose in■camera for disputed entries.”
**Anchors.** JC■36/37 • FGA■Privilege Log CSV.
8) Spoliation
**Signal.** “Data gone / overwritten.”
**One■liner Counter.** “Preservation letter date + system facts; seek adverse inference, costs, targeted
re■collection.”
**Anchors.** JC■38 • LC■Record Armor.
9) Corporate Practice of Medicine
**Signal.** “Business control over clinical decisions.”
**One■liner Counter.** “Show non■physician veto over clinical calls; compensation clawbacks tied to
non■clinical metrics; policy docs + emails.”
**Anchors.** JC■41 • LC■Healthcare Frame.
10) Informed Consent
**Signal.** “Signed form = consent.”
**One■liner Counter.** “Form ≠ disclosure. Contrast actual risk/alt discussion vs. boilerplate; patient notes +
timing.”
**Anchors.** JC■42 • LC■Evidence Cards.
D) Filing Blocks (ready to paste)
• **Opposition to 12(b)(6) Outline:** Intro → Elements table (element → dated fact → exhibit) → Standard →
Application by element → Narrow relief / leave to amend.
• **Personal Jurisdiction Sheet:** Contacts timeline; purposeful■availment bullets; forum effects; fairness
factors; service facts with exhibits.
• **MSJ Two■Column Chart:** CSV/MD table; cite declaration ¶¶, depo:page■line, Bates pages.
• **Compel Package:** Meet■confer pre/post emails; narrowed scope; privilege■log demand; proposed order +
fees certification.
E) Evidence Shopping List
• Dated HR docs (PIPs, reviews), payroll/credentialing timelines, preservation letters, ESI custodian list, policy
docs, board minutes, privilege logs, redlines of consent forms.
F) New JC Modules (proposed)
• **JC■45 — Meet■and■Confer as Evidence.** Build the sanctions path from the first email.
• **JC■46 — Two■Column Dispute Engine.** Convert record to MSJ■ready tables.
• **JC■47 — Privilege Log Weaponization.** From blanket claims to in■camera review.
• **JC■48 — Corporate Practice of Medicine.** Proving non■physician control.
G) Health Check (TNRPESC)
Run Timing → Narrative → Relief → Procedure → Evidence → Service → Citations before filing. Fix the
weakest link first.
**Care & Support.** Keep a weekly 20■minute check■in with a reliable ally to review one move, and consider a
brief counseling session during high■stress windows. Staying connected makes hard c
