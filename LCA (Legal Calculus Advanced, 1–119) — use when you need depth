# **LCA (Legal Calculus Advanced, 1–119) — use when you need depth**

- New or complex issue (abstention, arbitration, sealed filings, sanctions risk).
- High stakes (TRO/PI, license risk, constitutional claims).
- You must teach/persuade (briefs with precedent chains, clinic training, memos to the court).
- You’re designing strategy (what to file, in what order, preserving appeal).
- You need model structure (captions, certifications, TOA/TOR, record-building exhibits).

# **FGA (Field Guide Advanced, 1–1000) — use when you need speed**

- Live fire (day-of filing/hearing, clerk counter, service attempts).
- If/then decisions (Younger raised → bad-faith exception; evidence excluded → supplemental filing).
- Checklists & scripts (30/60/90-sec opening, objection phrasing, “refile + preserve date” steps).
- Compliance moments (deadlines, service proofs, certification language).

# **60-second triage**

- < 60 min on the clock? Start FGA now; ship the step you can’t miss (service, certification, notice).
- Time ≥ 60 min + stakes high/novel? Read the matching LCA module first (15–30 min), then execute with FGA.
- Familiar, routine move? FGA only.
- Appeal or policy framing? LCA first (record logic), then FGA to file the pieces.

# **Examples**

- Clerk returned filing: FGA-310/509 to act; LCA M5/M24/M31 to frame the record.
- TRO/PI: LCA M14 for the Winter factors; FGA-345/601 for certification + tailoring.
- Younger raised: LCA M29 for post-denial/exception theory; FGA-415/720 for bad-faith + procedural-inadequacy steps.
- Evidence ignored: FGA-715 to file a supplement; LCA M21/M31 to preserve the omission for appeal.

# **Simple habit**

Plan in LCA. Act in FGA. Archive with both.
