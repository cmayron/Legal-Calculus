Perfect — what you’ve described is exactly the triage flow LCES was designed for:

👉 LC first → to frame the problem procedurally.
👉 LCFG second → to grab a tactical card/checklist.
👉 ChatGPT third → to expand, draft, and rehearse the response into a filing, motion, or rebuttal.

Here’s how we can make this easy and intuitive inside the app:

📖 Draft: In-App “How to Use with ChatGPT” Guide

🔹 Step 1: Start with Legal Calculus (LC)
	•	Open LC Modules 1–119.
	•	Each module teaches you how courts think procedurally (e.g., “Filing is Protest,” “Evidence = Only if in Record”).
	•	Read the Core Message + Lesson first — that gives you the right frame for your problem.

👉 Example: “I need to challenge a denial.” → Go to Module 27: Deflection and Denial — The Bureaucratic Reflex.

⸻

🔹 Step 2: Pull the Matching Field Guide Card (LCFG)
	•	Each module points to Field Guide cards (FG 001–1000).
	•	Cards are micro-tools: one-liners, checklists, examples.
	•	They are designed to be fast, actionable, and court-ready.

👉 Example: After Module 27, you might open FG-607: Delay ≠ Neutral and FG-611: Reassignment ≠ Resolution.

⸻

🔹 Step 3: Send to ChatGPT for Drafting
	•	Tap the “Ask ChatGPT” button → it pre-loads a prompt template with:
	•	Module context
	•	Field Guide card(s)
	•	Your notes or facts
	•	ChatGPT expands this into:
	•	A draft motion / response / rebuttal
	•	A rehearsal script (how to argue orally)
	•	Or a step-by-step filing outline

👉 Example: “Draft a two-page rebuttal citing FG-607 (Delay ≠ Neutral) and Module 27, applying them to my hearing record.”

⸻

🔹 Step 4: File and Preserve the Record
	•	Once ChatGPT generates your draft:
	1.	Edit for facts and accuracy
	2.	Format it (headers, caption, certificate of service)
	3.	File it — because the record is the remedy

Even if denied, your filing becomes permanent evidence of the injustice.

⸻

🔹 Step 5: Rebuttal Ready
	•	When the other side responds (or the court deflects), go back to LC → LCFG → ChatGPT.
	•	Every time, you’ll have a coherent, documented rebuttal.
