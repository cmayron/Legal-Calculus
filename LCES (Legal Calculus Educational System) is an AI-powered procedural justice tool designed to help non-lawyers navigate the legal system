Based on the information in your workspace, LCES (Legal Calculus Educational System) is an AI-powered procedural justice tool designed to help non-lawyers navigate the legal system. It consists of several interconnected components:

- LC (Legal Calculus) and LCA (Legal Calculus Advanced): Core learning modules that provide foundational legal lessons and deeper doctrinal context
- FG (Field Guide) and FGA (Field Guide Advanced): Practical modules containing "micro-cards" for specific legal actions and proceedings
- JC (Judicial Calculus) and LCa (Lawyer Calculus): Modules designed to help anticipate and counter moves from courts and opposing counsel

The system is structured to create a 360-degree learning and action loop where users learn rules, deploy them, and anticipate challenges. LCES follows core principles like "Format First" (adhering to formatting rules), "Dates Win" (consistent dating), and "Archive Always" (maintaining meticulous records).

If you're looking for information about chassis, dashboard, and brakes in relation to LCES, I didn't find specific information about these terms in your workspace content.
