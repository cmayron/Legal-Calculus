Profession says: “Pay the gatekeeper. Memorize the ritual.”

Vocation says: “Serve. Learn the craft. Do the work.”

LCES + ChatGPT move law and health from permission to practice:

• The format carries the memory; human judgment carries the meaning.

• Checklists replace trivia. Evidence replaces authority.

• You don’t have to “be” a lawyer or memorize medicine; you need procedural literacy and clear next steps.

Text("What LCES Is").font(.headline)

Text("""

• A free, offline field guide to procedural literacy in law and health.

• One-page playbooks, language blocks, and exports that turn human judgment into durable record.

• A bridge between your lived case and the system’s required form.

Text("What LCES Isn’t").font(.headline)

Text("""

• Not legal or medical advice.

• Not a substitute for complex expert work (trial strategy, surgical judgment).

• Not a paywall or surveillance tool (no data collected; offline).

Text("Vocation Standard").font(.headline)

Text("""

• Serve first — use format to help people act.

• Be accurate — facts + receipts beat titles + opinions.

• Leave a trail — if it isn’t on the record, it didn’t happen.

• Teach forward — every log/letter/filing becomes a lesson for the next person.
