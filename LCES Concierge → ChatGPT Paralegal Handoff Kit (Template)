# Use the LC/FG/JC concierge page below. Draft all items under Deliverables needed, tailored to [court/jurisdiction]. Mirror the Relief sought verbatim in the Proposed Order. Include tender‑date language in both Notice and Motion, a COS, and a running Delay Log. Output a single Word + PDF packet with blanks for names/dates/exhibits. Keep captions formal, paragraphs numbered, tone respectful.

# **3) Quality Gates before Filing (TNRPESC)**

- Timing: every deadline stated; tender‑date recognized.
- Narrative: short, numbered facts; no orphan facts.
- Relief: Proposed Order mirrors “Relief sought” word‑for‑word.
- Procedure: correct caption, motion vs. letter, local rules cited.
- Evidence: each fact tied to a dated exhibit (Ex. A‑1, B‑2…).
- Service: COS present; names/addresses/methods correct.
- Citations: core rules/statutes included.

# Tip: grab one trusted friend to skim captions/dates (2‑minute buddy check). If the clerk games are spiking stress, a short counseling check‑in can keep your focus sharp while you ship.
