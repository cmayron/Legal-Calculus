LCES Field Guide — Master Index Plan (FG‑001…FG‑1000)

Purpose

A micro‑module Field Guide that operationalizes Legal Calculus across three complementary lenses:
	•	Judicial Calculus (JC): How courts and clerks behave (patterns, traps, remedies).
	•	Lawyer Calculus (LCa): How opposing counsel operates (tactics, tells, counters).
	•	Legal Calculus (LC): What you do (formats, filings, scripts, checklists).

Core motto: Filing = Protest · Format = Memory · The Record = Remedy

⸻

Numbering + Taxonomy
	•	FG‑001…FG‑333 — Judicial Calculus (JC)
Pattern recognition of court behavior; responses focused on procedure and preservation.
	•	FG‑334…FG‑666 — Lawyer Calculus (LCa)
Adversary tactics; counters that redirect back to the record.
	•	FG‑667…FG‑1000 — Legal Calculus (LC)
Your operational playbooks, templates, language blocks, and submission checklists.
