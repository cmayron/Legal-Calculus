# **LCES Legal Second-Opinion Run**

**1) Intake → Snapshot (you paste this)**

LCES | CASE INTAKE
Court + stage:
Claims / causes:
Relief sought (exact):
Absolute deadlines (MM/DD/YYYY):
Key dated facts (YYYY-MM-DD bullets):
Evidence/exhibits list (IDs + 1-liners):
Service status (who/when/how):
Procedural posture (what’s on the docket?):
Adverse moves expected:

# **2) Issue framing → Module Map (our reasoning)**

- LC (core): which foundational modules apply (e.g., LC-1 Filing=Protest, LC-2 Format=Memory, LC-14 Winter factors, LC-31 Archive=Appeal).
- LCA (advanced): doctrine/case-law hooks to strengthen each move.
- FG (quick): the micro-cards you’ll actually use mid-draft / hallway.
- FGA (annotated): short notes + analogies to keep you steady under pressure.
- JC (judge reflexes): likely court behaviors to pre-empt.
- LCa (lawyer tactics): opponent’s plays + your counters.

# Output: a one-page “Module Map + Threat Alerts” you can tape to your screen.

# **3) Standards → What controls this decision**

- Rules, standards, and local quirks you must satisfy (e.g., TRO factors, default protocol, mailbox/service rules, meet-and-confer traps).

# Output: Governing Standards sheet with the exact elements you need to hit.

# **4) Draft pack (you can file these)**

- Complaint / Motion / Memo shell (captioned, numbered facts, clean headings).
- Certificate of Service (COS) and Proposed Order.
- Notice of Filing & Request for Docket Clarification (if the clerk lags).

# Output: a folder of ready-to-edit docs, each with a 5-line checklist on page 1.

COS mini-template

[Caption]
CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE
I certify that on [DATE], I served [document(s)] by [METHOD] on:
[NAME/ADDRESS/EMAIL/FAX].
[If mail:] Under [jurisdiction] mailbox rule, service is effective upon [postmark/deposit].
[Signature block]

Docket-clarification mini-template

[Caption]
NOTICE OF FILING AND REQUEST FOR DOCKET CLARIFICATION
Plaintiff submitted [items] via [method] on [DATE] (Proof: Exh. A [tracking/receipt]).
As of [DATE], no docket entry/number appears. Please docket forthwith or provide a
written order stating the basis for refusal. Plaintiff preserves the filing date of [DATE].
[Signature block]

# **5) Evidence pack → Memory that survives silence**

- Exhibit index (A, B, C… with date/source/what it proves).
- File-name and label scheme that matches captions and your FG cards.

# Output: Exhibit Index + stamps so the record is self-authenticating.

# **6) Service + Docket-watch routines**

- Calendar pings for T-0/T+3/T+7 follow-ups.
- Phone/email scripts + “what to do if mail/efiling is bounced.”

# Output: Ops checklist you (or a helper) can run without thinking.

# **7) Hearing kit (if a conference or motion is coming)**

- 30/60/90-second opening aligned to the governing standard.
- Trap → Counter cards (e.g., “vexatious,” “no harm,” “service defect”).
- Status checklist and a debrief log to capture rulings and next steps.

# Output: one printable page + three micro-cards.

Opening (90-sec) skeleton

Purpose: [What you’re asking for, precisely].
Standard: [X elements]. Today I show [Element 1: cite/record], [2], [3]...
Relief: [Tailored order language]. Prejudice if delayed: [1-liner].

- “You’re vexatious.” → “Volume ≠ vexatious. Each filing targets a required element (see Index p.1). I’m preserving rights efficiently.”
- “No irreparable harm.” → “Harm is immediate and not compensable by money: [fact/date/record cite]. Relief is tailored.”
- “Service defective.” → “COS attached; if the court finds defect, I request a brief cure order and deem prior date preserved.”

# **8) Archive & Appeal posture (LC-31 discipline)**

- Versioned PDFs, stamped proofs, timeline, and a “refile/appeal” pack.

# Output: Archive bundle you can hand to an appellate clerk tomorrow.

# **JC / LCa Threat Matrix (starter)**

- Filing stage:
    - JC: Docket delay / “administrative return.”
    - LCa: Pretextual meet-and-confer to stall.
    - Counters: FG-001 (existence by filing), FG-004 (silence ≠ settlement), FG-010 (COS), Notice of Clarification.
- 
- Injunction/TRO:
    - JC: “Extraordinary remedy” strictness.
    - LCa: Attack irreparable harm; propose overbroadness.
    - Counters: LC-14 Winter map; narrow relief paragraph; declarations.
- 
- Dismissal / default:
    - JC: “Judicial efficiency” framing.
    - LCa: Conflate default with consent.
    - Counters: LC-5 / FG-005 (Default ≠ Consent); precise Rule 55 steps.
- 
- Discovery / sanctions:
    - JC: Discretion emphasis.
    - LCa: Label “burdensome/bad faith.”
    - Counters: Proportionality factors; targeted requests; certification lines.
-
