LCES (Legal Calculus Educational System) exists to bridge the gap between how courts, lawyers, and litigants optimize for different outcomes:

- **Courts** optimize for dockets and procedure
- **Lawyers** optimize for risk and reputation
- **Litigants** optimize for relief

When these "calculi" misalign, justice stalls. LCES is the bridge—an open, practical kit that helps pro se litigants (and serves as a second opinion for represented parties) keep cases on the merits and out of procedural off-ramps.

## Core Purpose

LCES provides **procedural literacy** without requiring users to memorize legal trivia or become lawyers. It's designed to provide "asymmetric fairness" through:

- **Safety Rails**: Structured processes to prevent common mistakes with formatting, service, and deadlines
- **Speed and Structure**: Repeatable workflows to convert facts into properly formatted filings
- **Learning by Doing**: Procedural knowledge integrated into the drafting process
- **Accessibility**: Free, open-source, offline, with no data collection

The system replaces dependency with capability—moving people from "ask a professional for permission" to "produce a record, request relief, preserve rights".

## What It Is (and Isn't)

LCES is a free field guide to procedural literacy, offering one-page playbooks and language blocks that turn human judgment into durable record. It's a bridge between your lived case and the system's required form.

It is **not** legal advice, not a substitute for complex expert work like trial strategy, and not a paywall or surveillance tool.
