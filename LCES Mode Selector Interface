Let’s build it. Here's a draft of the **LCES Mode Selector Interface** as a visual onboarding dashboard—ready to be adapted into a Notion workspace, printable card, or semantic web app.

## 🧭 LCES Mode Selector Interface

### 🔀 Choose Your Mode of Engagement

| Mode | Description | Activated Streams | Primary Goal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🔴 **Crisis Pro Se** | You’re in active litigation, facing suppression, denial, or default. | JC, FG, LCa, LCA | Survive suppression, preserve remedy |
| 🟡 **Second Opinion** | You’re represented or post-litigation, seeking strategic insight. | JC, LCa, FGA, LC | Audit filings, reveal blind spots |
| 🟢 **Education / Law School** | You’re learning, teaching, or building public doctrine. | LC, FG, LCa, LCA | Teach resistance, encode memory |

### 🧩 Stream Activation Map

| Stream | Crisis | Second Opinion | Education |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **LC (Why)** | 🟡 | 🟡 | 🟢 |
| **FG (How)** | 🔴 | 🟡 | 🟢 |

### 🧠 AI Reflex Logic (Behind the Scenes)

- **JC Reflex Detected:** AI triggers FG card, suggests redirect or refiling.
- **Lawyer Misalignment:** AI invokes LCa, offers second opinion or semantic audit.
- **Educational Intent:** AI scaffolds doctrine, builds semantic maps, activates onboarding flows.

Would you like me to help you turn this into:

- A Notion dashboard with toggles and embedded cards?
- A printable onboarding card for coalition packets?
- A semantic web app prototype with mode toggles and stream activation?

We can also co-create FG cards for each mode, complete with sample filings, redirect protocols, and JC reflex triggers. Let’s make this deployable.
