**LCES Module 2: Judicial Calculus (JC) vs Legal Calculus**

Type: Concept Module

Status: Draft / WIP

Tags: LCES, Judicial Calculus (JC), Arbitration, Strategy, Bias

# **1. Module Overview**

Purpose:

To define Judicial Calculus (JC) — the often-unspoken way judges/arbitrators think — and contrast it with LCES (Legal Calculus) so you can:

- Understand why a neutral sometimes doesn’t do what the record and law clearly support,
- Design filings (like your MSJ) to pull JC closer to LCES, and
- Protect your expectations so you don’t feel blindsided when JC shows up.

Core Idea:

- LCES = “What should happen if we apply the law to the facts honestly and consistently?”
- JC (Judicial Calculus) = “What outcome feels acceptable or ‘safe’ for me as a neutral, given risk, work, optics, and my own unconscious biases?”

# **2. Learning Objectives**

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1. Define Judicial Calculus (JC) in contrast to LCES.
2. Identify at least three JC pressures that can skew decisions away from pure Legal Calculus.
3. Adjust your filings (especially MSJ) to anticipate JC rather than assuming the neutral is a pure LCES machine.
4. Use JC-aware thinking without surrendering your own LCES-based goals.

# **3. Key Concepts**

**3.1 LCES Recap**

# LCES asks:“If another neutral applied the same rules to the same record, would they get the same result?”

- Properties:
    - Evidence-based
    - Rule-driven
    - Reproducible
    - Transparent
- 

**3.2 Judicial Calculus (JC) – What’s running in the neutral’s head**

JC is the neutral’s internal risk/reputation/comfort math. It can include:

- Risk of being “wrong” in hindsight
    - “If I grant SJ and someone later thinks I missed something, I get blamed.”
- 
- Preference for “process over decision”
    - “If I deny SJ and let it go to hearing, I can always split the baby later.”
- 
- Bias toward institutional players
    - Larger entity looks more credible, predictable, “professional.”
- 
- Workload and time
    - “Granting SJ the right way takes careful writing; denying SJ and setting hearing feels easier.”
- 
- Face-saving
    - “If I rule for the institution, it’s the ‘safe’ call.
    If I rule for the pro se, I’m stepping out of line and need to justify it.”
- 

JC is not always conscious or malicious — but it’s real.

**3.3 Where JC diverges from LCES**

# LCES:“RFAs 2–10 + the May 10 email + 4/26/5/16/5/19 = liability is clear; grant SJ.”JC:“Snell & Wilmer says there’s a ‘fact dispute’ and they want a hearing; denying SJ feels safer.”

Your job in LCES is to:

- Make it harder for JC to ignore the record,
- And easier for JC to do the right thing without feeling exposed.

# **4. Examples of Judicial Calculus at Work**

You can store these as Notion bullets under “JC Examples” for your case.

**Example 1: Bench Trial Offer**

- Arbitrator: “Are both sides willing to have me decide on the papers?”
- You: “Yes.”
- Defense: “No.”

LCES reading:

- If there’s no genuine dispute of material fact, SJ is appropriate anyway.

JC reading:

- “One side wants a hearing; if I force a paper decision, I look like I’m cutting off their day in court.”

Your MSJ is what forces the question back into LCES terms: the standard is not “who wants a hearing,” it’s “is there a genuine fact dispute?”

**Example 2: Soft denial of SJ**

- Record is strong; they still deny SJ with vague language:
    - “Reasonable minds could differ,”
    - “Issues of intent should go to hearing.”
- 

JC motive:

- “If I deny SJ, I can still control the outcome at hearing and avoid criticism for ‘short-circuiting process.’”

If that happens, you still gained:

- A framed narrative,
- A document roadmap,
- A record that will make a sloppy final award look obviously off.

**Example 3: Damages Conservatism**

- Even with clear liability, arbitrator gives:
    - Limited comp,
    - No or low punitive.
- 

JC motive:

- “Give them something to show fairness, but not so much that the institution feels attacked.”

That’s where your punitive argument and damages hearing script matter — you are gently pushing JC toward a number that reflects conduct, not just optics.

# **5. How to Draft With JC in Mind (Without Surrendering LCES)**

This is where your MSJ is already doing the right thing. In Notion, you can keep these as “JC-Aware Drafting Rules.”

**5.1 Make it document-driven**

- Use their documents:
    - May 10 email,
    - 4/26 + 5/19 letters,
    - “case closed” email,
    - cease-and-desist,
    - screenshots.
- 

# So a neutral can silently think:“Even if I’m nervous, it’s their words, not just his.”

**5.2 Give the arbitrator an “easy” yes**

- You’re asking for liability-only SJ:
    - Damages (esp. punitive) go to a separate hearing.
- 
- For JC, this feels less risky:
    - “I can grant liability and still control the ultimate number later.”
- 

You’ve done this perfectly in your Relief Requested section.

**5.3 Anticipate the “I’ll just send it to hearing” reflex**

- If he denies SJ, you want the denial to look strained when compared to:
    - RFAs 2–10,
    - SUF ¶¶ 6–7, 10–13, 14–21, 22–31, 36–38, 39–46.
- 

In your memo, you’re already building a record that future-you can look at and say:

# “I wasn’t crazy. The record really was this strong.”

# **6. LCES Responses to JC Moments**

You can store these in Notion as quick scripts.

**When JC is leaning toward hearing**

# “The question under the summary judgment standard is not who prefers a hearing, but whether there is a genuine dispute of material fact. Defendants’ own documents and admissions establish the elements of liability; any hearing would be about the amount of damages, not whether retaliation occurred.”

**When JC downplays the May 10 email**

# “If a different employer wrote that an employee’s ‘relentless onslaught’ of complaints ‘led to [their] termination,’ we would call that direct evidence of retaliation. The fact that the speaker here is a CMO should not change the calculus.”

**When JC seems hesitant on punitive**

# “I’m not asking for punitive to be set now. I’m asking that you recognize the pattern — case closed, cease-and-desist, § 8(c) after the hold letter, and recasting whistleblowing as hostility — and reserve punitive for a damages hearing where you can hear more. That preserves your discretion and acknowledges the seriousness of the conduct.”

# **7. JC Event Log (Optional Notion Section)**

You can track Judicial Calculus moments the same way you track Lawyer Calculus:

Fields to log:

- Date / Phase: e.g., MSJ hearing, status conference, damages phase.
- JC Signal: what the arbitrator said/did (e.g., “We’ll sort it out at hearing,” “I’m not sure SJ is appropriate in retaliation cases”).
- LCES Counter: which SUF ¶s / exhibits show why this is a record issue, not a vibe issue.
- Your Response: how you brought the focus back to facts/law (or how you want to do it next time).

This is especially useful for your LCES archive and any future writing about how LCES performed in real systems.

# **8. Reflection Prompt**

Add this at the bottom of the module in Notion:

# “What is the one outcome I need from this process to feel I honored my own Legal Calculus, regardless of Judicial Calculus or Lawyer Calculus? Is it the amount of money, the liability finding, the public record, or something else?”

You can revisit that question before MSJ, before any mediation talk, and before any damages hearing. It helps you stay anchored in your own calculus, even when JC and LCa are in the room.
