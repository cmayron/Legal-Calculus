System: LCES (Legal Calculus Educational System)

Status: Core Concept Module

Tags: LCES, JC, LC, LCA, FG, FGA, LCa, Strategy, Bias

# **1. Where JC Fits in the Six Calculi**

LCES runs on six distinct calculi — six “engines” that describe how legal outcomes are generated or distorted:

1. LC – Legal Calculus
2. LCA – Legal Calculus Advanced
3. FG – Field Guide
4. FGA – Field Guide Advanced
5. LCa – Lawyer Calculus
6. JC – Judicial Calculus

High level:

- LC / LCA / FG / FGA = your tools (evidence + law + strategy + playbook).
- LCa / JC = system distortions (lawyer reality/bias + judge/arbitrator reality/bias).

This module focuses on JC, and how it interacts with LC and LCA.

# **2. Quick Recap of the Six Calculi**

**2.1 LC – Legal Calculus**

- Baseline engine.

# Question:“If we apply the governing law to the actual record (SUF + exhibits + transcripts + RFAs) consistently, what should the outcome be?”

- Your SUF + MSJ memo are LC artifacts.

**2.2 LCA – Legal Calculus Advanced**

- LC + system behavior + strategy.

# Question:“Given this record and how the system behaves, what sequence of moves best aligns with truth and survivable risk?”

- Example: using RFAs + a carefully timed MSJ before the March 31 deadline even though you know an arbitrator might still want a hearing.

**2.3 FG – Field Guide**

- The “how-to” layer.

# Question:“What exactly do I do next?”

- Example: “Serve RFAs by Nov 22; build SUF in this format; attach these exhibits; file MSJ by mid-March.”

**2.4 FGA – Field Guide Advanced**

- FG as a teaching system.

# Question:“How do we turn these moves into reusable patterns for others?”

- Example: LCES modules, templates, and case-study style lessons.

**2.5 LCa – Lawyer Calculus**

- Lawyer’s internal risk/fee/optics engine.

# Question:“Given risk, fee, time, and my reputation, what’s a ‘good enough’ outcome for me?”

- Typical outputs:
    - “Settle for ~80k; that’s respectable; avoid the risk of zero.”
    - “Don’t push too hard; I need a ‘win’ that looks good on my stats.”
- 

**2.6 JC – Judicial Calculus**

- Judge/arbitrator’s internal risk/comfort/reputation engine.

# Question:“What outcome feels acceptable and safe for me as a neutral, given this record, these parties, and my own risk tolerance?”

JC is not a legal standard; it’s the human layer sitting on top of the law.

# **3. What JC Actually Is**

**3.1 Definition**

Judicial Calculus (JC) is the non-transparent math running in a judge’s or arbitrator’s head:

- Risk of being criticized for granting SJ or ruling against an institution.
- Workload: how much time/energy a careful written decision takes.
- Institutional sympathy: “big entity vs lone pro se.”
- Preference for live process over clean written resolution.

JC is often unspoken and sometimes unconscious — but it heavily influences decisions.

# **4. How JC Diverges from LC / LCA**

**4.1 LC / LCA view of your case**

LC/LCA looks at your record and says:

- RFAs 2–10
- SUF ¶¶ 6–7, 10–13, 14–21, 22–31, 36–38, 39–46
- May 10 email (“relentless onslaught… led to your termination”)
- 4/26 + 5/16 + 5/19 letters
- “Case closed” email + cease-and-desist
- Missing 2/20 and 3/6 threads

→ Legal Calculus output:

# “Liability is clear. Summary judgment on liability is appropriate. Damages (including punitive) can be decided later.”

**4.2 JC view of the same case**

JC may say:

- “Snell & Wilmer say there are factual disputes; they want a hearing.”
- “Granting SJ for a pro se against a big institution feels risky; denying SJ feels safer.”
- “If I deny SJ, I can still do a ‘balanced’ ruling at the end.”

→ Judicial Calculus output:

# “Let’s lean toward a hearing or a soft denial, even if the paper record is strong.”

Your job is not to pretend JC doesn’t exist, but to draft so that:

- It is easier for JC to align with LC/LCA (grant liability SJ), and
- Harder for JC to ignore the record without looking obviously stretched.

# **5. JC at Work in Your Case – Concrete Examples**

**Example 1 – Bench Trial vs. Hearing**

- Arbitrator: “Are both sides willing to have me decide on the written record?”
- You (LC/LCA): “Yes. Let the documents and law decide.”
- Defense / Snell (LCa): “No. We want a hearing.”
- JC:
    - Risk view: “If I force a paper decision over their objection, they might say I cut off their day in court.”
    - Comfort move: “I’ll keep the option of a hearing.”
- 

Your MSJ (LC/LCA) exists to reframe this:

# “The question is not who prefers a hearing; it’s whether there is a genuine dispute of material fact under the SJ standard.”

**Example 2 – SJ vs. Hearing Reflex**

Even with a strong record, JC may think:

- “If I deny SJ, I can still fix things at hearing.”
- “If I grant SJ and someone later thinks I missed something, I’ll be criticized.”

That’s why your MSJ is:

- Document-heavy,
- Tied tightly to SUF paragraph numbers and admissions,
- Narrow in ask (liability only).

You’re giving JC a low-risk path to do the right thing.

**Example 3 – Damages & Punitive**

LC/LCA:

# “Given the timing, retaliation pattern, and record manipulation, punitive damages are on the table under Arizona’s ‘evil mind’ standard.”

JC:

# “Compensatory is easier; punitive feels risky. Maybe I’ll be conservative or avoid it unless it’s unavoidable.”

Your punitive section is written to:

- Ask to reserve punitive for a damages hearing,
- Not force JC to set a number now,
- Make it easier to say: “Yes, this pattern is serious enough to consider punitives later.”

# **6. Drafting With JC in Mind (Without Surrendering LCES)**

**6.1 LC/LCA: What you’ve done right**

- You structured your SUF and memo so:
    - Each element (protected activity, knowledge, adverse action, causation, pretext) has specific SUF ¶s and exhibits.
    - The record is their words, not just your perspective.
    - Your Relief Requested explicitly asks for:
        - Liability SJ now,
        - Damages hearing later.
    - 
- 

This is LC/LCA design that accommodates JC’s risk concerns.

**6.2 LCES Rule: Give JC a “Comfortable Yes”**

You’re not asking the arbitrator to:

- Set full damages + punitive on paper immediately.

You’re asking:

- “On this paper record, decide liability now.
You can decide how bad it is, and how much to award, in a separate hearing.”

For JC, this is a lower-risk yes than “decide everything now.”

# **7. JC-Aware Scripts (For Hearings / Conferences)**

You can store these in Notion as quick reference.

**When JC leans into “we should just have a hearing”**

# “Under the summary judgment standard, the question is whether there is a genuine dispute of material fact, not whether one side prefers a hearing. Here, the key facts come from Defendants’ own documents and admissions. A hearing would go to the amount of damages, not whether retaliation occurred.”

**When JC soft-pedals the May 10 email**

# “If a different employer wrote that an employee’s ‘relentless onslaught’ of complaints ‘led to [their] termination,’ we would call that direct evidence of retaliation. The fact that this is a CMO in a large system shouldn’t change that legal analysis.”

**When JC hesitates on punitive**

# “I’m not asking the Arbitrator to set punitive damages now. I’m asking that the retaliatory pattern be recognized and punitive be reserved for a damages hearing, where the full risk to patients and my career can be explored.”

# **8. Reflection: Your LC vs Their JC**

A short prompt you can keep at the bottom of this module:

# “When the arbitrator uses Judicial Calculus, what outcome am I not willing to compromise on?

# Is it the truth of the record, the liability finding, the public story, the amount, or some combination?”

Your MSJ, SUF, and LCES work are all anchored in LC and LCA. JC and LCa will swirl around it — but they don’t have to control your goals.
