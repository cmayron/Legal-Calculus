**LCES Module 4: Working With Counsel vs Lawyer Calculus**

System: LCES

Scope: How to use lawyers without letting Lawyer Calculus (LCa) burn your money or override your aims

Tags: LCES, LCa, Counsel, Cost Control, Strategy

# **1. Module Purpose**

You’ve seen the pattern:

# Pay a lawyer → they “get up to speed” and burn money → they make nice with opposing counsel → they push mediation / settlement → if you resist, you become “the problem.”

This module exists to:

- Help you spot Lawyer Calculus (LCa) in your own counsel,
- Set guardrails around scope, spend, and settlement,
- Keep your LCES goals (truth, focused record, survivable cost) at the center.

# **2. Key Concepts**

**2.1 Your Calculus vs Their Calculus**

- Your LCES goals:
    - Present a clear, document-driven retaliation story.
    - Preserve your ability to pursue Feldman/NY if needed.
    - Avoid burning limited funds on work that doesn’t move liability or damages.
- 
- Typical Lawyer Calculus (LCa):
    - Maximize defensible billable hours.
    - Prefer broad discovery and “belt-and-suspenders” everything.
    - Prefer mediation/settlement as the “smart” outcome.
    - Avoid being seen as “difficult” by opposing counsel/courts.
- 

The gap between those is where your money and narrative get at risk.

# **3. When You Need Counsel (and When You Don’t)**

Arbitration (AHLA):

- You’re staying pro se:
    - MSJ built.
    - SUF built.
    - RFAs 2–10 served.
- 
- Counsel optional and limited-scope only:
    - Review MSJ if needed,
    - Help prep for hearing (outline, cross themes),
    - Not to re-run or re-own the arbitration.
- 

Arizona Civil Case (AVP / Regeneron / Feldman):

- You do need counsel at some point:
    - Defense MSJ,
    - Complex discovery,
    - Trial.
- 

Your job: bring them in for the right fights, not for everything.

# **4. Guardrails You Can Set With Any Lawyer**

Use these as headings/checklist in Notion.

**4.1 Scope Guardrail**

# “I want you focused on the Arizona civil case, not taking over the arbitration.

# In arbitration, I remain pro se. If you help there, it will be specific tasks only (e.g., reviewing my MSJ or helping prep for hearing).”

**4.2 Spend Guardrail**

# “My resources are limited. Before we do any major piece of work, I want:

# – a brief explanation of what it is,

# – why it’s necessary, and

# – a rough cost estimate.

# If you see fees likely to exceed $X for a phase, please talk to me first so I can decide if I want to proceed.”

**4.3 Simplicity Guardrail (Feldman, etc.)**

# “On Feldman and related fronts, I want a simple, focused theory:

# – what he saw,

# – what he did,

# – how it hurt my career.

# I’m not comfortable funding broad, open-ended fishing expeditions. If you believe something extra is truly essential, explain how it connects to that core theory.”

**4.4 Settlement / Mediation Guardrail**

# “I’m not opposed to mediation or settlement in principle, but:

# – I will not agree to mediation as a foregone conclusion,

# – I will not accept a settlement that rewrites this as a ‘communication problem’ instead of retaliation.

# I need to know you can keep representing me if I prefer to push forward rather than take a low number.”

# **5. Red Flags in Counsel Behavior**

Add these as bullet points you can check against:

- Repeatedly “re-asking” the same questions you’ve already answered in writing.
- Wanting to “start from scratch” with your evidence instead of engaging with your SUF and docs.
- Talking more about:
    - “Looking reasonable in front of Snell / the judge”
    than
    - “Positioning your record and claims.”
- 
- Early and heavy emphasis on:
    - “We’ll probably end up mediating anyway,”
    - “You don’t want to risk getting zero,”
    before they’ve really engaged with your documents.
- 

If you see a pattern of this early, that’s a sign not to commit your retainer.

# **6. Scripts You Can Actually Say**

Keep these as quick snippets in Notion to copy/paste into email or say in a consult.

**6.1 In the first serious consult**

# “I’ve already built a detailed factual record and MSJ in arbitration.

# For Arizona, I’m looking for:

# – focused use of discovery,

# – strong response to any defense MSJ, and

# – a trial-ready story if needed,

# not an open-ended, bill-heavy re-investigation.”

**6.2 When they want to expand scope**

# “Before we add more work here, can you explain in a sentence or two how this will move the needle on:

# – liability, or

# – damages?

# If it’s mostly belt-and-suspenders or ‘just in case,’ I’m not in a position to fund that.”

**6.3 When mediation comes up**

# “I’m willing to consider mediation if it’s based on an honest understanding of what happened and its impact, not on pretending this was a mutual misunderstanding.

# I may choose not to accept a number you think is safe. I need to know you can live with that and still advocate for me.”

# **7. How This Fits Into LCES (Meta Layer)**

- LC: What the law + facts demand.
- LCA: How you sequence moves (arbitration MSJ now, civil case later).
- FG/FGA: The tools and modules you’ve built (SUF, MSJ, RFAs, transcripts, this counsel module).
- LCa: Your lawyer’s internal incentives.
- JC: Arbitrator/judge’s internal comfort calculus.

This module is about making sure LCa doesn’t hijack LC/LCA and that you don’t end up paying someone to mediate against your own story.
