**Module ID:** LC-RFA-001

**Track:** Discovery Strategy

**Phase:** Requests for Admission (RFA)

**Difficulty:** Intermediate

**Estimated time:** 10–15 minutes

**Learning objectives**

- Recognize a 'Silent Win' (a qualified admission that already satisfies your litigation objective).
- Apply the rule: do not reopen a closed door by demanding a cleaner admission.
- Extract the admitted clause and convert it into a one-sentence Statement of Fact for briefing.
- Pivot from notice to causation/pretext using targeted follow-up questions (ROG/RFP), not meet-and-confer.
- Avoid arbitrator/judge goodwill loss from semantic motions.

**Core concept**

A Silent Win is a moment where the opposing party gives you the fact you needed, but wraps it in defensive language designed to provoke you into unnecessary negotiation or motion practice.

Your job is to pocket the admitted core fact, preserve it for briefing, and move on.

**Definitions**

**Silent Win**

An admission that locks the element you were trying to prove (often notice/knowledge), even if the response contains qualifiers, disclaimers, or argumentative caveats.

**Qualified or conditional admission**

A response that admits an event occurred but adds language denying the truth/merit of what was reported. This is common when the admitted event contains value-laden terms (e.g., 'patient safety').

**The Legal Calculus**

When the core fact is admitted, the legal objective of that RFA is met.

Attempting to 'clean' the language usually causes strategic harm:

- You invite the opponent to rewrite an already-useful admission into something narrower or more evasive.
- You spend arbitrator/judge goodwill ('arbitrator capital') on semantics rather than substance.
- You signal insecurity about the strength of your own evidence.
- You create unnecessary correspondence that can later be used to paint you as over-litigious.

**Decision rule**

Use this three-step rule whenever you read an RFA response:

1. Identify your objective (e.g., notice to leadership on dates X–Y).

2. Ask: did they admit the objective fact? If yes, stop. Do not meet-and-confer.

3. Treat extra language as: (a) a merits dispute for later, or (b) pretext evidence.

**Builder vs Inspector Protocol**

Purpose: Separate drafting (Builder) from deployment decisions (Inspector).

Builder (Drafting Mode):

- Draft the strongest possible cleanup email/motion as if you will send it.
- Extract the admitted clause and draft a one-sentence Statement of Fact.
- Draft pivot requests (ROG/RFP) that force specifics on who/when/what.

Inspector (Deployment Mode):

Ask one question: Did they admit the objective fact?

- If YES → Silent Win. Do not send cleanup. Pocket the admission and pivot to causation/pretext.
- If NO → Deploy the Builder draft focused on the missing objective fact.

LCES maxim: Builder drafts aggressively. Inspector decides whether to deploy.

**Do / Don't**

**Do**

- Quote only the admitted clause in your Statement of Facts.
- Save the full paragraph for impeachment or pretext framing later.
- Use follow-up interrogatories/requests for production to force specificity on who decided you were 'wrong,' when, and based on what.

**Don't**

- Do not ask for a stipulation to 'confirm' what they already admitted.
- Do not demand they delete caveats unless the caveat changes the admitted core fact.
- Do not file a motion over wording cosmetics when the element is already locked.

**Case-study template (generic)**

RFA (notice/protected disclosure):

“Admit that between [DATE RANGE], Claimant raised [SAFETY/COMPLIANCE] concerns to [LEADERSHIP ROLE].”

Typical response (Silent Win):

“Admitted that Claimant raised concerns to leadership during [DATE RANGE]. However, this should not be construed as admitting the concerns were valid or that any violation occurred.”

Correct move: pocket the admission; do not negotiate the caveat.

**Briefing language you can paste**

“Respondent has admitted that Claimant raised [SAFETY/COMPLIANCE] concerns to leadership between [DATE RANGE]. Respondent’s dispute about ‘validity’ goes to merits/pretext, not notice.”

**Strategic pivot: from notice to causation/pretext**

Instead of fighting over caveats, force the opposing party to commit to specifics:

**High-yield follow-up interrogatory (template)**

“State with specificity the factual basis for Respondent’s contention that Claimant’s concerns were ‘not valid,’ including (a) who made/approved that determination, (b) when it was made, (c) what steps were taken to evaluate the concern, and (d) what documents were reviewed or created.”

**High-yield production request (template)**

“Produce all documents and communications reflecting or relating to any evaluation, investigation, or discussion of Claimant’s reported concerns, including communications with clinical leadership, management, compliance, billing, and prior authorization staff.”

**Silent Win checklist**

- Did they admit the element you needed (notice/knowledge/timing)?
- If yes: extract the clause and store it as a numbered fact in your timeline.
- Tag the caveat as 'merits contention' or 'pretext evidence.'
- Do not send a cleanup email; do not ask for stipulation.
- Redirect energy to causation: timeline, decisionmakers, and stated reasons vs. record.

**Common mistakes**

- Conflating 'they admitted I complained' with 'they admitted I was right.'
- Treating defensive caveats as a defect that must be corrected immediately.
- Spending motion practice on wording when the admission already satisfies your goal.
- Failing to convert the admission into a one-sentence fact for briefing.

**Practice drill (5 minutes)**

Take the qualified admission below and complete tasks A–C.

Qualified admission:

“Admitted that Claimant raised concerns to leadership on March 11–13. However, Respondent denies the concerns were valid and denies any underlying safety issue.”

**A) Statement of Fact (one sentence)**

[Write your one-sentence fact using only the admitted clause.]

**B) Pretext line (one sentence)**

[Write your one-sentence pretext line using the caveat.]

**C) Pivot request (one interrogatory)**

[Draft one interrogatory that forces who/when/what investigation.]
