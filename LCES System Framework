## Core Components

### Legal Calculus (LC) 🧰

**The Action Engine**

- 119 modules that move cases forward
- Checklists + language blocks = filing in one pass
- Format today, argue tomorrow

- Every step leaves a trail; the trail is your remedy

### Judicial Calculus (JC) 🧭

**Court Reading System**

- Read the court's reflex before it reads you
- Gatekeeping patterns, decoded
- Translate minute orders into strategy
- Expect discretion; answer with format
- Rulings are data, not destiny

### Lawyer Calculus (LCa) 🛡️

**Tactical Counter-System**

- Spot the tactic; drop the counter
- Plausibility chop? Anchor your facts and survive
- Proportionality cudgel? Narrow, demand proof
- Arbitration squeeze? Preserve, object, timeline
- Discovery stay? Tie relief to the record

## Field Guide Resources
