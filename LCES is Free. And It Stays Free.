The Legal Calculus Education System is deliberately built on Notion AI, where anyone can access it without cost barriers, subscriptions, or institutional permission. That matters for one reason:

# If justice requires money, it isn’t justice.

Lawyers and institutions will push the idea that legal knowledge must stay controlled, licensed, or hidden behind paywalls. But LCES rejects that model entirely. By using Notion AI as the foundation, the system stays:

- Open
- Public
- Searchable
- Runnable by anyone
- Zero-cost at the point of use

And most importantly:

# The same AI assistance that institutions use privately is now available to the public openly.

This is the part gatekeepers won’t like—but it’s also the part that makes LCES inevitable. As courts and governments quietly adopt AI to cut costs and speed up procedure, the public must have parallel tools. Otherwise, justice becomes a one-way algorithm.
