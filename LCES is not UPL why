LCES is designed specifically **not** to constitute unauthorized practice of law (UPL). Here's why:

**It's an educational tool, not legal advice**

LCES explicitly positions itself as a "free, offline field guide to procedural literacy" and makes clear it is "not a substitute for lawyers". It's a "second opinion, a guide, and a survival kit—not formal representation".

**It provides formats and frameworks, not case-specific counsel**

The system offers templates, checklists, and procedural guidance—teaching *how* to structure filings rather than telling someone *what* to argue in their specific case. It's described as providing "one-page playbooks, language blocks, and exports that turn human judgment into durable record"—the user still makes all substantive decisions.

**Users retain full responsibility**

The credibility statement emphasizes that "users must edit, verify, and take responsibility for filings". LCES doesn't represent anyone or make decisions on their behalf.

**However, regulatory concerns persist**

Despite these safeguards, legal institutions remain cautious. Regulatory bodies "would have to carefully vet the system to ensure it doesn't cross the line into providing legal advice without a license". The ABA has issued guidance on AI in law that focuses on lawyers' duties to verify AI work, "not on AI as a direct tool for the public".

The core question is whether teaching procedural literacy crosses into practice. LCES takes the position that providing formats and educational resources—similar to legal self-help books or court-provided form libraries—stays on the permissible side of that line.
