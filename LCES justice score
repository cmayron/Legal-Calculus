If We Don’t Count Injustice, We Excuse It

People say justice is hard to measure. Usually that means we aren’t measuring it. If a city never tracked 911 response times, leaders could claim success forever. Courts and agencies do a version of this daily. Those with lawyers absorb friction; those without are told their losses are “procedural.”

I created the Legal Calculus Educational System (LCES) because too many people—especially pro se and Spanish-speaking residents—hit walls the system doesn’t even count: late dockets, bounced filings, forced arbitration with fees shifted to the party least able to pay. We treat these as administrative footnotes. They are outcomes.

We don’t need a decade-long study; we need a habit. The LCES Injustice Score (I-Score) is a simple 0–100 composite any court, clinic, or newsroom can compute from public facts—no legal theory required. It tracks six practical signals: Procedural Friction (rejections, clerk refusals, compelled arbitration, fee-waiver denials); Delay (days to docket; days to TRO decision); Language Access (interpreter provided; translated core forms); Outcome Disparity (relief vs dismissal on pure procedure); Financial Burden (out-of-pocket costs, hours, arbitration fees); and Remedy Risk (job loss, reportable registries like the NPDB, health impact). Each case receives a number and a bucket: Low (<40), Moderate (40–69), Severe (≥70).

What changes when we count? First, honesty: a monthly dashboard showing that, say, a third of pro se employment disputes score “Severe” is a public mandate to fix the pipeline. Second, priorities: numbers reveal where to invest—interpreters, timelines, or fee policy. Third, accountability without blame: a rising I-Score is a system signal, not a scarlet letter for a judge or clerk.

Arbitration deserves special scrutiny. When courts compel it, the I-Score records the fee shift and practical consequences. If compelled arbitration consistently drives vulnerable parties into “Severe,” we should revisit who pays, how timelines are enforced, and whether the practice is compatible with equal justice.

A plain test for safety-net sufficiency: Can a Spanish-speaking pro se litigant with a meritorious claim reach relief most of the time? If the data can’t show yes, then the answer is no. The fixes aren’t mysterious: provide interpreters as a right, translate core forms, train staff—and count it.

What gets measured gets managed. If we keep calling injustice “nebulous,” we license it. Start counting. Then start improving.
