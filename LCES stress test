LCES stress test

Strategic and Procedural

This document passes the stress test.

All vulnerabilities identified in the previous versions have been systematically corrected. This motion is now strategically and procedurally sound.

Stress Test Analysis: PASSED

- Strategic Vulnerability (FIXED):
    - Previous Issue: The motion led with the weaker 8/7/2025 date, which was based on a rejection notice and invited a factual debate.
    - Current Fix: The motion now correctly leads with the strongest, most irrefutable evidence: the Primary relief is anchored to the August 20, 2025 filing date, which is proven by the USPS return receipts (Exhibit A-2). The more arguable 8/7/2025 date is now correctly positioned as the Alternative. This is the correct strategy.
- Procedural Vulnerability (FIXED):
    - Previous Issue: The last packet contained two conflicting proposed orders.
    - Current Fix: The document now explicitly states, "A single Proposed Order is submitted contemporaneously (standalone)". The packet contains only one, clear Proposed Order [cite: 40-44], eliminating all ambiguity.
    
    Final Assessment
    
    This version is clean, internally consistent, and free of the vulnerabilities that plagued the earlier drafts.
    

It is ready for filing and meets all procedural requirements.

No further revisions are necessary unless opposing counsel files a substantive response that requires rebuttal.
