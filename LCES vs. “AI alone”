# **LCES vs. “AI alone”**

- AI alone = unstructured answers that can drift, miss deadlines, or invent steps.
- LCES = a structured wrapper (checklists, prompts, filing formats, safety rails) that keeps AI inside the lanes of facts → law → procedure → record. It turns AI into a reliable paralegal, not a chatty guesser.

# **What each pillar does (and when to use it)**

- LC (Legal Calculus) — What & Why. Core modules that teach principles and patterns (claims, elements, TRO/PI, record-building). Start here for foundation.
- LCA (Legal Calculus Advanced) — More. Deep dives, edge cases, doctrine conflicts, exception handling, and “if X then Y” trees. Use when LC flags complexity.
- FG (Field Guide) — How. Clickable how-to cards: step sequences, checklists, templates, fill-ins. Use mid-draft and before filing.
- FGA (Field Guide Advanced) — How+. Tighter timelines, multi-venue interplay, parallel remedies, exhibits strategy, preemption/abstention traps. Use when the clock is hot or forums collide.
- JC (Judicial Calculus) — Reality. “What actually happens” in court: gatekeeping, off-ramps, performative orders, docket drift, and counter-moves. Use before hearings and when orders look… off.
- LCa (Lawyer Calculus) — Representation issues. Co-counsel frictions, scope, privilege, fee levers, withdrawal risks, arbitration clauses, and how to partner with counsel without losing the record.
