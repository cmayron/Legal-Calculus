I see you'd like to build out the individual components of your LCES workspace. I notice that I've already created the main dashboard page for you. Would you like me to now create the individual subpages for:

1. FG Card Registry
2. JC Reflex Log
3. Exhibit Registry
4. Ops Buddy Tracker
5. Coalition Onboarding Portal

Or would you prefer that I create a sample case workspace (like Tenant Defense or Civil Rights) with preloaded cards and reflexes? I can create any of these pages for you to customize.
