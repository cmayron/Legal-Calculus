urpose: ground every motion in measurable judicial incentives and evidence-based law. predict behavior, box options, force the safest path.

**🧮 Judicial Calculus (What judges optimize for)**

- Least-appealable path: procedural off-ramps (service cure, mootness, defer-then-decide).
- Docket efficiency: one-bite filings; status-quo orders that freeze controversy.
- Record protection: Rule 52(a)(2) findings; clear timelines; exhibit-driven facts.
- Reputational safety: avoid First Amendment exposure; favor narrow relief over broad constitutional rulings.

**⚖️ Lawyer Calculus (What you optimize for)**

- Win the smallest possible ask: status-quo only (no exam, no releases) beats full TRO.
- Box the opposition: make denial costlier than granting (Mathews + Winter + no prejudice).
- Appeal-proof every sentence: dates in text; statutory service (Commissioner); Rule 52 findings.
- Evidence-first: exhibits (C, D, G–J) + affidavit + tracking > argument.

**📊 Evidence-Based Law Outcomes (Data points)**

- Post-speech pivot: Younger bad-faith (Diamond "D" 282 F.3d 199) + facts (misattribution after notice).
- Mathews factors: DiBlasio (2d Cir.) — pre-deprivation relief when post-deprivation inadequate.
- Winter factors: Walsh 488 F.Supp.3d (irreparable harm + likely success + balance + public interest).
- Service cure: Rule 4(l)(3) + 4(m) extension (no prejudice) + Rule 1 (just/speedy).

**🎯 LCES in Practice (One-liner scripts)**

Younger (judicial calculus): "Grant status-quo; defer constitutional ruling; no Younger bar (bad-faith pivot)."

Service (lawyer calculus): "4(m) deem-timely on proofs; no prejudice; decide the PI (Rule 1)."

Mathews (evidence-based): "DiBlasio + pre-deprivation timing + inadequate post-deprivation (licenses/income)."

Winter (appeal-proof): "Irreparable harm (Walsh 488); likely success (First Amendment); balance/public interest favor status-quo."
