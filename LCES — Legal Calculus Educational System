What is LCES?

LCES turns lived litigation into structured learning and fast action. It’s a set of one‑page playbooks (Field Guide) and a teaching archive (Legal Calculus Modules) that help you build a durable record across filings, hearings, and appeals.
	•	Judicial Calculus (JC): How courts/clerks behave; patterns, traps, remedies.
	•	Lawyer Calculus (LCa): How opposing and your own counsel behave—risk‑aversion, “don’t upset the judge,” incentives vs. client rights—and the counters.
	•	Legal Calculus (LC): What you do—formats, checklists, language blocks, preservation.

Educational use only. LCES does not provide legal advice.

Proof of Record (Verification)

LCES is grounded in public, third‑party records—not marketing copy. Court dockets and legal indexes surface the underlying filings.

Why it exists

Because access to justice shouldn’t depend on privilege. LCES documents suppression patterns and equips people to convert silence and spin into public legal memory.
