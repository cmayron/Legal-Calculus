# **LCES — Notion README + Pillars Template (v1)**

# Educational Toolkit — Not legal advice. You’re responsible for your filings and deadlines. Use this to structure facts → law → procedure → record.

# **Modes at a Glance (When to Use What)**

- LC (Legal Calculus) — What & Why. Principles, elements, and patterns. Start here.
- LCA (Legal Calculus Advanced) — More. Edge cases, exceptions, parallel doctrines, decision trees.
- FG (Field Guide) — How. Step-by-step cards, checklists, templates, fill‑ins.
- FGA (Field Guide Advanced) — How+. Tight clocks, multi‑venue interplay, abstention/preemption traps.
- JC (Judicial Calculus) — Reality. Gatekeeping, off‑ramps, docket drift, counters.
- LCa (Lawyer Calculus) — Representation Issues. Scope with counsel, fee levers, withdrawal risk, partnering without losing the record.

# **Safety Rails (TNRPESC)**

- T — Timing: Compute every deadline explicitly (file/serve/respond/appeal).
- N — Narrative: Chronology in clean, numbered facts.
- R — Relief: Precise orders requested; include a proposed order.
- P — Procedure: Venue, posture, rules invoked, standard of review.
- E — Evidence: Exhibits, declarations, recordings, cites to the record.
- S — Service: Who/when/how; attach proofs (tracking, receipts, ECF IDs).
- C — Citations: Controlling authority first; pinpoint cites.

# **Quickstart Workflow (Pin to the top of your Notion Home)**

1. Collect Pillars (facts/claims/relief/procedure/evidence/service/citations/risks).
2. Run the LCES Concierge Prompt (below) with your Pillars.
3. Draft: caption → intro → facts → counts → relief → proposed order → certificate of service.
4. FG Preflight checklist.
5. JC Stress Test (anticipate off‑ramps; add counters).
6. If triggers appear (abstention, arbitration, emergency timing), escalate to LCA/FGA.
7. File and Archive (y**Notion Homepage README**

# **Pillars of Knowledge (Template)**

Paste as a Notion template called “LCES Pillars” and fill every section.

# LCES Pillars

## 1) Facts (Chronology)

- Parties & roles:
- Key dates (YYYY‑MM‑DD):
- What happened (numbered):
- Current posture (what’s pending, what’s due):

## 2) Claims & Elements

- Claim A: [cite elements]

- Element 1 → Proof in record:

- Element 2 → Proof:

- Claim B: …

## 3) Relief Sought

- Orders requested (exact language):
- Tailoring (scope, duration, who is bound):
- Proposed Order: [Y/N] (attach or draft)

## 4) Procedure

- Court/venue:
- Rule(s) invoked:
- Standard(s) (e.g., Winter factors):
- Deadlines (computed):

## 5) Evidence

- Exhibits list (ID → description → where cited):
- Declarations (who, what they attest):
- Record cites (ECF/CM/Tracking IDs):

## 6) Service Plan

- Who must be served:
- Method(s):
- When (date/time zones):
- Proof (receipt/ECF notice):

## 7) Citations

- Controlling authority (constitutions, statutes, binding cases):
- Persuasive authority:
- Pinpoint cites:

## 8) Risks & Traps

- Jurisdiction/abstention/exhaustion/arbitration issues:
- Sanctions/fees exposure:
- Parallel proceedings:

# **LCES Concierge Prompt (for any AI)**

Paste after your Pillars when you ask an AI for help.

Use LC (foundation) + FG (how) + JC (reality). If complexity appears, escalate to LCA/FGA.

1) Map **claims → elements → proof**, flag missing facts or weak elements.

2) Build a **procedural path** (venue → motion(s) → timing → service) with explicit deadlines.

3) Draft an outline: **caption; intro paragraph; numbered facts; claims by count; requested relief; proposed order; certificate of service.**

4) Run an **FG preflight** checklist (format, exhibits, service, rule cites).

5) Do a **JC stress test**: likely off‑ramps/gatekeeping and my counters.

6) If needed, propose **LCA/FGA** strategies (exceptions, parallel remedies, appellate posture).

7) Output: **filing‑ready Word outline** + a concise **Notion checklist** of “before file” tasks.

# **FG Preflight (Checklist)**

- [ ]  Dates/deadlines computed + shown in text
- [ ]  Elements table complete (each element has proof)
- [ ]  Relief tailored + Proposed Order attached
- [ ]  Exhibits labeled, cited in text, and attached
- [ ]  Declarations drafted where needed
- [ ]  Proper captions/signatures/certificates present
- [ ]  Service plan specific (who/when/how) + proof path
- [ ]  Pinpoint citations to controlling authority
- [ ]  Pagination/TOC (if long); clean numbering of facts
- [ ]  Archive plan: what receipts/IDs to save same‑day

# **JC Stress Test (Reality & Counters)**

Likely Off‑Ramps → My Counter

- “Procedural defect” → Show rule compliance + attach proof
- “No irreparable harm” → Tie facts to constitutional/unique harms
- “Not ripe / moot” → Timeline graphic + live controversy cites
- “Jurisdiction/abstention” → Exceptions (bad faith/inadequacy), record cites
- “Arbitration” → Unconscionability/waiver/scope; preserve appeal
- “No standing” → Injury‑in‑fact + traceability + redressability table
- “Discretionary denial” → Controlling standards + tailored, narrow relief

# **LCa Scope with Counsel (1‑Page Memo)**

Title: Scope of Representation & Record Discipline

Goals: [what outcome]

Scope: [tasks counsel handles / tasks I retain]

Comms: Preferred channels; turnaround time; draft review steps

Deadlines: Shared calendar; who computes; who files

Format Control: Elements tables; proposed orders; service proofs mandatory

Archive: Same‑day saving of ECF IDs, tracking, receipts

Withdrawal/Fees: Triggers; estimates; costs approvals; arbitration clauses

# **Light Teaming**

- Create a Notion “Review Circle” page: add 1–2 trusted peers/clinic mentors for pre‑file reviews.
- Add a weekly Grounding Check‑In note (what went well, what to fix next week). Keeping a small circle or therapist involved can make the workload more sustainable.
