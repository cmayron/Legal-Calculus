LCES — The People’s Law School (Overview & How‑To)

LCES is a free, AI‑powered procedural justice primer. ChatGPT‑5 Thinking does the heavy drafting and planning; LCES keeps everything safe, structured, docket‑ready, hearing‑ready, and appeal‑ready. It doesn’t replace lawyers—it makes the system legible so you can act.

1) The Ecosystem (Parts & Purpose)
LC (Legal Calculus): Core teaching modules (1–119). Short lessons + assignments.

LCA (Legal Calculus Advanced): Deep commentary on LC. Doctrine, cross‑links, reflections.

FG (Field Guide): 1,000 micro‑cards for live use (filings, hearings, appeals).

FGA (Field Guide Advanced): Annotated FG cards with examples and links to LC/LCA.

JC (Judicial Calculus): Court reflexes and how to pre‑empt them.

LCa (Lawyer Calculus): Defense/big‑law tactics and your counters.

Together they form a 360° map: learn (LC/LCA) → deploy (FG/FGA) → anticipate (JC/LCa).

2) Why Use LCES
• Safety rails: prevents avoidable mistakes (format, service, docket, deadlines).

• Speed + structure: turns facts → filings → record → archive—all labeled and dated.

• Asymmetric fairness: anticipates JC/LCa moves before they land.

• Learning while doing: every draft teaches (LC/LCA) while producing file‑ready work.

• Open + free: a public on‑ramp to procedural justice—the “People’s Law School.”

• Not legal advice and doesn’t replace a lawyer; it’s a primer + workflow that helps you use the rules well—and work with counsel better.

4) How to Use (Legal Second‑Opinion Run)
Step 1 — Intake → Snapshot:

LCES | CASE INTAKE
Court + stage:
Claims / causes:
Relief sought (precise text for order):
Absolute deadlines (MM/DD/YYYY):
Key dated facts (YYYY-MM-DD bullets):
Evidence / exhibits (ID • date • what it proves):
Service status (who/when/how):
Procedural posture (what’s on the docket?):
Adverse moves expected (opponent + court):

Step 2 — Module Map + Threat Alerts: LC/LCA to learn; FG/FGA to act; JC/LCa to anticipate.

Step 3 — Governing Standards Sheet: Elements, local quirks, and the tailored order language.

Step 4 — Draft Pack: Complaint/Motion/Memo, Proposed Order, COS, Notice of Filing & Docket Clarification.

Step 5 — Evidence Pack: Exhibit Index with date/source/what it proves; tight file‑naming.

Step 6 — Service + Docket‑Watch: T‑0/T+3/T+7 checks; meet‑and‑confer log; escalation script.

Step 7 — Hearing Kit: 30/60/90‑sec opening, Trap → Counter cards, status checklist, debrief log.

Step 8 — Archive & Appeal Posture: Versioned PDFs, proofs, timeline. The archive is the appeal.

5) Core Prompts
• Map this to LC/LCA/FG/FGA and list JC/LCa counters.

• Draft COS + Docket Clarification using these facts: [paste].

• Give me a 90‑sec opening tied to [standard].

• Turn these filenames into an Exhibit Index with a one‑line ‘what it proves.’

6) Where the Content Lives
• GitHub: the Legal‑Calculus repo holds LC (v4.5), FG (1–1000), and assets (visuals, kits).

• Notion: public landing page + module navigation.

• Substack: serialized lessons and outreach.

• App (LCES): realized through ChatGPT‑5 Thinking as the authoring engine—an AI “super‑app.”

• Credit: Author — ChatGPT‑5 Thinking. Creator — Charles Mayron, MD, FACS.

7) Safety & Accountability (Rails)
• Format first: captions, numbered facts, specific relief, signature blocks.

• Dates win: everything dated (timeline, proofs, COS, receipts).

• Tailor relief: orders written narrowly to the harm and the record.

• Document silence: if the court delays, file the notice and preserve the date.

• Archive always: PDFs, hashes if possible, and a simple Timeline.md linking proofs.
