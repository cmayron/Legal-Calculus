Legal Calculus Educational System (LCES) is a free, open, UPL-safe education + document-prep workflow that helps people gain procedural literacy when they can’t afford a lawyer or can’t find one to take the case.

Not a law firm. Not legal advice. Education and document preparation only.

# **One-sentence mission**

“Free procedural literacy for the people left out of the legal market.”

# **The triad (LC = Why · FG = How · JC = Reality)**

- LC (Why): Why the record matters—“Filing is protest. Format is memory. The record is the remedy.”
- FG (How): Step-by-step checklists and templates to turn a story into compliant paperwork.
- JC (Reality): Practical constraints you’ll face in real courts—timelines, clerk/judge reflexes, risk flags.

# **How it works (UPL-safe)**

User Narrative → Architect (Notion AI) → Blueprint JSON → Builder (ChatGPT, paralegal-like, non-interactive) → Strategist (Compliance stress test) → Filing

- Architect: educational scaffolding—structures facts; does not give advice.
- Builder: paralegal-like document assembler (lobotomized); not a lawyer; no chat.
- Strategist: compliance activity (not legal advice)—checks completeness, consistency, procedural fit.

# **Who it’s for**

- People who can’t afford counsel, are declined by attorneys, or are going pro se by necessity.
- Clinics, libraries, and community orgs that want clean, lawyer-ready packets for limited-scope help.

# **What LCES is**

# **not**

- Not a law firm, not a lawyer, not legal advice.
- Does not choose claims, strategies, forums, or predict outcomes.

# **Cost & access**

- Free and open. Materials and templates remain accessible without paywalls.
- Lawyer hand-off is encouraged when advice is needed (referral links + clean files for review).

# **Start here (4 steps)**

1. Orientation: LC = Why · FG = How · JC = Reality
2. Blueprint Intake: enter parties, dates, facts, exhibits, service choices
3. Assemble: caption, exhibit index, certificate of service, table of contents
4. Compliance Check: Strategist stress test → log → file

# **Escalation & referrals (paste this near every page footer)**

- Need legal advice? Contact your state bar referral program or a court self-help center.
- LCES will export lawyer-ready .docx/PDF with manifest + checksums for quick attorney review.

# **Public pledge (use as a banner)**

“LCES will always offer a free path to procedural literacy and document preparation for the disadvantaged. We are not a law firm and do not provide legal advice. When advice is needed, we help you hand off to counsel with clean, review-ready files.”

# **Short FAQ**

- Does this replace lawyers? No. LCES prepares documents; lawyers advise and advocate.
- Why free? Because most civil legal problems go unmet; education + clean paperwork lowers the first barrier.
- Is this UPL? No. Roles are separated; Builder is non-interactive; Strategist is compliance; no legal advice.
