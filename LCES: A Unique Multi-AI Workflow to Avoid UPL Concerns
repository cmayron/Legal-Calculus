**Overview**

Legal Calculus Educational System (LCES) uses a unique three-stage multi-AI workflow designed specifically to maintain clear boundaries and avoid unauthorized practice of law (UPL) concerns.

### The Three-Stage Architecture

**1. Architect (Notion AI / Gemini)**

Provides the conceptual blueprint using the 6 layers of LCES:

- **LC** — Legal Calculus core modules (1-119)
- **LCA** — Legal Calculus Advanced with deeper doctrinal commentary
- **FG** — Field Guide (1,000 tactical cards)
- **FGA** — Field Guide Advanced with annotations
- **JC** — Judicial Calculus (the judge's playbook)
- **LCa** — Lawyer Calculus (the lawyer's playbook)

**🔨 2. Builder (ChatGPT)**

Takes the structured blueprint and expands it into full drafts, motions, or filings. Operates as a format provider within constraints, not an advice-giver.

**3. Inspector (Gemini 2.5 / Peer Reviewer)**

Serves as the verifier, using the Two-Reader Rule to cross-check citations, standards, and procedural hygiene.

### How This Avoids UPL

**Educational Framework** — LCES is positioned as teaching procedural literacy, not providing case-specific legal advice.

**Separated Functions** — Each AI performs a distinct role (structure → draft → verify), with the human retaining responsibility for facts, ethics, and final decisions.

**Open Disclosure** — All content was authored by ChatGPT (GPT-5) and this is disclosed openly. Users must verify and take responsibility for their filings.

**Free & Open-Source** — Licensed under Creative Commons (CC BY-NC-SA), marked "Educational use only".

**Core Philosophy** — LCES provides procedural scaffolding and empowers through education, not by replacing lawyers.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

<aside>
🏗️ **Architect**

Builds the framework using LCES layers — no legal advice, just structure

</aside>

<aside>
✍️ **Builder**

Expands into full drafts — format provider, not decision-maker

🔍 **Inspector**

Verifies accuracy using Two-Reader Rule — quality control layer

## ✅ Key Safeguards

- [x]  Educational framework teaches procedural literacy
- [x]  Separated AI functions with human oversight
- [x]  Open disclosure of AI authorship
- [x]  Free & open-source under Creative Commons
- [x]  User retains full responsibility for filings

> 💡 **Remember:** LCES provides the scaffolding — *you* provide the facts, judgment, and final responsibility. This is education, not representation.
