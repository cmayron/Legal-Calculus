Tagline: Turn small harms into public accountability.

# **The Problem**

Too many people swallow everyday corporate harms with a resigned, “it is what it is.” The reason isn’t apathy—it’s cost. Traditional remedies are expensive, slow, and stacked against individuals. Regulatory bodies exist but are over‑burdened and rarely address one‑off complaints at speed. Corporations know this and lean on the cost‑benefit gap to let low‑grade misconduct pile up.

# **The Solution: LCES (Legal Calculus Educational system )**

LCES is a structured, affordable pathway to expose and deter corporate misconduct—especially the “small” issues that are everywhere but rarely challenged.

What makes LCES different

- Affordable by design: Removes the paywall on accountability.
- Built for low‑level, high‑volume issues: Targets the everyday harms that add up.
- Exposure > silence: Prioritizes public visibility to counter quiet suppression.
- Levels the field: Neutralizes the resource advantage corporations rely on.

# **How LCES Works (4 Steps)**

1. Collect — Guided intake captures facts, receipts, screenshots, and timelines.
2. Format — Auto‑generate clear, citation‑ready briefs and public summaries.
3. Expose — Publish to a verifiable public record and notify responsible parties.
4. Escalate — Provide pathways to regulators, small‑claims/arbitration, media, and community allies.

# Principle: Filing is protest. Format is memory. The record is the remedy.

# **Why This Matters**

- Corporations have long banked on the reality that most people cannot afford to fight.
- The result is a landscape of unchallenged “minor” harms that normalize unfairness.
- LCES flips the economics: when exposure is cheap and standardized, misconduct becomes costly to maintain.

# **Who It’s For**

- Consumers, workers, tenants, patients, and caregivers facing “not worth a lawyer” harms.
- Advocates, clinics, and community groups building local accountability.

# **Benefits**

- Access: Anyone can initiate a credible record in minutes.
- Speed: Templates and checklists reduce the time from harm → exposure.
- Credibility: Evidence‑first formatting resists dismissal and PR spin.
- Deterrence: Public, searchable records raise the price of repeat behavior.
- Community lift: Neighbors and peers can replicate wins and share playbooks.

# **Current State vs. With LCES**

Now

- High costs block action
- Agencies overwhelmed or disengaged
- Corporations exploit the gap
- Pervasive low‑level injustices
- Resignation becomes culture

With LCES

- Affordable access to remedies
- Direct exposure of misconduct
- Higher corporate accountability
- Deterrence through visibility
- A cultural reset toward fairness

# **Call to Action**

- Start an exposure file today: add your receipts, dates, and a 5‑sentence summary.
- Publish the record with one click; notify the company and relevant channels.
- Join a local accountability circle to swap checklists and compare outcomes.

Feeling stuck or burned out? It helps to talk it through. A quick chat with a counselor—or simply teaming up with a friend—can make the next step much easier.

# **30‑Second Pitch**

LCES turns “not worth the fight” into “too costly to ignore.” By standardizing intake, formatting, and public exposure, it makes small harms visible, searchable, and escalating—so corporations face real reputational and regulatory pressure without individuals spending big on lawyers.

# **One‑Sentence Summary**

LCES is a low‑cost system that transforms everyday corporate harms into credible public records that drive accountability and deterrence.

# **Notion/Substack Drop‑In (Short Version)**

LCES: Affordable Justice — Most corporate harms go unchallenged because justice is priced out. LCES flips the economics with guided intake, auto‑formatted filings, and one‑click public exposure. Small harms become searchable records, patterns emerge, and deterrence follows. Start a file, publish, and—better together—organize a neighborhood or clinic circle to multiply impact.
