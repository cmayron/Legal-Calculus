# **How to use LCa in your Second-Opinion Run**

1. Spot the tactic: scan LCa tiers that match your stage.
2. Paste “Signals” you see into your memo.
3. Pull counters from LC/FG you’ve already mapped (e.g., LC-2, LC-14, LC-31; FG-001, FG-004, FG-010).
4. Add a short section in your brief: “Anticipated Defense Tactics & Narrow Tailoring.”
5. Keep a one-line LCa Log (date • tactic • your filed counter).
