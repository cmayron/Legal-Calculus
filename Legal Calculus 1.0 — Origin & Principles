What 1.0 Was
- Proof‑of‑concept that structured filing shifts power toward unrepresented parties.
- Early articulation of three axioms: Filing = Protest • Format = Memory • Record = Remedy.
- Prototype modules that later became Tier 1 (1–5).


Core Moves (Starter)
- Write a clean Notice of Filing to create legal existence.
- Use caption • numbered facts • bold relief as a default skeleton.
- Treat the docket as a timeline; log delays and plan next moves.


Artifacts
- Caption & relief clauses
- Exhibit label + foundation snippet
- 5‑entry docket timeline example


Audience
