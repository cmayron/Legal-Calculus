Common Pitfalls & Traps

- Stale Parties/Service List. Certificates or captions that don’t reflect new counsel, new parties, or capacity (individual vs. official).
- Undated Facts. Assertions without dates → no chronology → weak record.
- No Pinpoints. Case cites without page/paragraph pinpoints; exhibit cites without page IDs.
- Wrong Rule / Wrong Relief. Citing the wrong rule or asking for relief the rule doesn’t authorize.
- Overbreadth. Requests or orders that are broader/longer than needed; courts dislike overreach.
- Local‑Rule Misses. Page limits, font, margins, certifications (word count), meet‑and‑confer statements.
- Service Method Mismatch. Email when e‑file or mail is required; forgetting to serve non‑ECF parties.
- Missing Proposed Order. Forces the court to draft for you; raises friction.
- COS Defects. No date, method, or full addresses; missing signature block.

How to Self‑Audit

- Run the TNRPESC pass: Timing, Narrative, Relief, Procedure, Evidence, Service, Citations.
- Confirm dated facts + exhibit labels on every assertion you rely on.
