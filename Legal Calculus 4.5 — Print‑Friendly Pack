# **125 — Preemptive Formatting: Paper Hearing + Options Order (Anti‑JC‑13)**

⚖️ Core Message — Make a reasoned order faster than a minute entry by shipping a Paper‑Hearing statement and a check‑box Proposed Order (A/B).

# **Lesson**

# **Assignment**

Draft a one‑screen Issues Presented block and attach a signable A/B Proposed Order to your next motion.

# **Model**

“Suitable for decision on the papers. Proposed Order (A/B) attached.”

·       No proposed order

·       No pin‑cites

# **Reflection**

Make the good path the easy path.

# **126 — Chain‑Verified Pleading + Source Ledger (Anti‑JC‑19)**

⚖️ Core Message — Allegation + inline parenthetical pin‑cite + exhibit/hash defeats “conclusory.”

# **Lesson**

·       Place pin‑cites **in the sentence** (parentheticals).

·       Restrict assertions to facts you can pin to a page.

# **Assignment**

Convert 10 complaint allegations to chain‑verified sentences with in‑line pin‑cites.

CSV columns: Document • Date • ECF • SHA‑256 • Mirror • Notes.

# **Reflection**

Novelty, stated plainly, disarms the label.

# **130 — Docket Hygiene Preemptor: Service Map + COS + Deadline Grid**

⚖️ Core Message — Format errors fuel reflex denials; prevent them with hygiene work products.

# **Lesson**

·       **Service Map**: parties, capacities, methods; keep current.

·       Propose staged discovery; demand a privilege log with specifics.

·       Attach the meet‑and‑confer chain to your compel motion.

# **Assignment**

Prepare pre‑ and post‑confer emails for one RFP with 14‑day rolling production.

Stand up the schema and enter 25 facts with exhibit links and elements.
