## Mission

**Access to justice, in a box**

LCES is a free, MIT/CC‑BY curriculum + toolkit that turns procedural rules into step‑by‑step checklists, court‑ready templates, and verified‑evidence workflows.

## Who it helps

**Self‑represented people & clinics**

Built for pro se litigants, legal aid teams, and educators who need repeatable, rule‑compliant filings without big‑law budgets.

## Why it works

**Format over discretion**

The system emphasizes formatted compliance, verifiable facts, and clear relief—so courts can reach the merits instead of off‑ramps.

## How it works — the A • B • S triad

### **Architect (facts & exhibits)**

Curate facts, label exhibits, and anchor timelines. Output: a verified record with hyperlinks and evidence tags.

### **Builder (court‑ready drafts)**

Generate pleadings, motions, service packets, and disclosures that track the rules (captions, certificates, TOCs, proposed orders).

### **Strategist (stress‑tests)**

Run "reflex" checks (jurisdiction, timeliness, issue preservation, abstention, default) before filing; then iterate.

*Guardrails: no legal advice; cite‑first drafting; privilege awareness; privacy‑first exhibits; UPL‑safe handoffs.*

## Ethics & boundaries

LCES is educational. It is not legal advice and does not create an attorney–client relationship. Users remain responsible for facts, filings, and compliance. Clinics should supervise students consistent with jurisdictional UPL rules.

## Contact & coalition

For collaboration, pilots, or to mirror the curriculum, email [cmayron@aol.com](mailto:cmayron@aol.com). To help grow LCES, consider pairing a community workshop with a local pro‑se help center—building a little team around this can make the journey lighter and more sustainable.
