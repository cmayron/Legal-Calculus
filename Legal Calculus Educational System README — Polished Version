### Overview

**Legal Calculus Educational System (LCES)**

**Open‑source legal literacy for pro se litigants. Not legal advice — a public educational toolkit.**

**Legal Calculus** reframes litigation as **information organization**. It pairs structured curriculum, court‑ready templates, and a multi‑AI quality control pipeline so people can build, preserve, and present the legal record with confidence. The system equals **human persistence + AI scaffolding = procedural empowerment**.

### Quick Start

**Get started in five steps**

1. **Clone the repo**`git clone <https://github.com/cmayron/Legal-Calculus`>
2. **Read the Quickstart Checklist**`lc-framework-quickstart-checklist-v45.md`
3. **Download templates**`lc-template-pack-v45.zip`
4. **Use Field Guides for urgent filings** and Study Guides for deeper learning
5. **Validate drafts** against local court rules before filing

**Crisis Mode** — jump to the Crisis Mode section for emergency filing guidance.

### Three‑AI Architecture

**Division of labor for safer automation**

- **Architect AI** — encodes strategy, maps legal elements, and produces machine‑readable policy artifacts.
- **Builder AI** — drafts documents, populates templates, organizes exhibits, and formats filings.
- **Inspector AI** — validates citations, enforces formatting, checks deadlines, and surfaces risks.

**Human strategist** sets thresholds, resolves disputes, and signs off on high‑risk filings. This pipeline creates a one‑person law‑firm workflow with built‑in quality control.

### What’s Included

**Core curriculum and practical tools**

- **Modules**: 119+ modules covering Court Basics, Pleadings, Evidence, E‑Filing, Hearing Prep, Appeals, and Enforcement.
- **Field Guides**: quick checklists for immediate filings.
- **Templates**: court‑ready motions, declarations, and exhibit logs.
- **Element Mappers**: legal requirement checklists for common causes of action.
- **Evidence Ledgers**: contemporaneous fact‑tracking systems.
- **Motion Scaffolding**: stepwise drafting templates.
- **Study Guides**: progressive learning paths for procedural literacy.

### People’s Law School Approach

**Principles that guide every module**

- **Procedural literacy first** — know how courts work before you litigate.
- **Format as survival** — correct formatting prevents dismissals.
- **The record is the remedy** — a clean record preserves rights and remedies.
- **Learning by doing** — templates and checklists enable immediate action while teaching principles.

### Why Legal Calculus Is Unique

**Designed for public access, governance, and court readiness**

- **Open and free** — CC0 public domain license.
- **Procedural focus** — full system for building the record, not just legal research.
- **Three‑AI governance** — Architect, Builder, Inspector plus human strategist for auditability.
- **Scalable and localizable** — forks and modules let communities adapt to local rules.
- **Educational depth** — a full curriculum, not a single tool.

### How to Use the Repository

**Immediate filing workflow**

1. Open `/Field-Guides/` and select your document type.
2. Follow the checklist step‑by‑step.
3. Use Builder AI to draft and Inspector AI to validate.
4. Confirm local court rules and file with proof of service.
5. Save validated drafts to `/packets/`.

**Learning workflow**

1. Start with `/Modules/Foundations/`.
2. Progress through Study Guides 1–5 for basics.
3. Practice with sample scenarios and build your Element Mapper.
4. Maintain an Evidence Ledger from day one.

**AI‑assisted drafting workflow**

1. Use an Architect model for strategy and element mapping.
2. Provide facts and elements to Builder AI for drafting.
3. Run Inspector AI’s 8‑step validation pass.
4. Human strategist reviews flagged items and signs off.

### Governance and Safety

**Provenance, thresholds, and community norms**

- **Machine‑readable calculi** — lawyer calculus and judicial calculus encoded as JSON/YAML with versioning.
- **Forkwatch ledger** — public provenance logs for forks, intent declarations, and model decisions.
- **Validation thresholds** — disagreement scores and risk bands that trigger human review.
- **Local stewardship** — community maintainers curate jurisdictional modules.
- **Safety nets** — strategist sign‑off required for high‑risk filings and public audit trails for overrides.

### Contribution Guide

**How to help build the commons**

- Fork the repository and create a branch for your changes.
- Submit PRs with clear documentation and tests.
- Contribute jurisdiction templates, anonymized case studies, translations, accessibility improvements, and new modules.
- Join discussions in Issues and help curate the Forkwatch ledger.

### Crisis Mode

**If you must file immediately**

1. Go to `/Field-Guides/` and find the matching document type.
2. Run the 8‑step Inspector validation checklist.
3. Confirm formatting and deadlines with local court rules.
4. File with proof of service and keep copies.
5. Follow up with supplemental filings if needed.

**Remember**: a timely, imperfect filing is often better than a perfect, late one.

### Impact Metrics and Pilot Plan

**Track what matters**

- **Adoption**: active forks and local deployments.
- **Trust**: percentage of filings passing Inspector checks without human override.
- **Impact**: cases where procedural compliance preserved rights or avoided dismissal.
- **Sustainability**: funding covering core infrastructure.

**Pilot plan** (suggested): run a 6‑week pilot in one jurisdiction to measure format compliance, citation accuracy, human‑override rate, and court acceptance.
