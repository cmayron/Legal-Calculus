Legal Calculus project:

✅ Completed
	•	Legal Calculus 4.5 is fully assembled — modules, visuals, summaries, and outreach kits — and ready for deployment on Notion, Substack, GitHub, and Google Classroom.
	•	Tier structure is confirmed (Foundations, Lawfare Resistance, Futures, Coalition, Sovereignty, Archive).
	•	Modules 1–84 (Tiers 1–6) have been drafted, with many already enhanced to the “locked” teaching format (intro, lesson, assignment, model answer, visual).
	•	Modules 85–100 (Tier 7: Procedural Memory & Public Archive) are outlined and ready to be fleshed out.
	•	Modules 101–119 are still in the pipeline, but the framework is clear.
	•	Preface & Reflections (e.g., How It Came to Be, What Charlie Will Inherit, My Oath Didn’t End in the Exam Room) are slotted in for the opening and closing archive.
	•	Visual assets are already integrated into many modules, and we have the instruction to embed an image into every module (1–119).

🚧 In Progress
	•	Module-by-module preservation — starting with Module 1 in final format — so that nothing gets lost in export or platform transfer. This is the careful step-by-step rebuild across Word, Notion, Substack, GitHub, Google Classroom, LinkedIn, and PDFs.
	•	Field Guide (the quick-reference, task-oriented companion) is in mid-assembly — you confirmed readiness to complete it last week.
	•	Study Guide (assignments + model answers in one workbook) is outlined but waiting until module preservation is finished.

🔜 Next Steps
	1.	Resume module-by-module rebuild (we already locked Module 1, and Module 2 was next on the list).
	2.	Package Tier 1 (Modules 1–5 + Enhanced 4.0 Summary) as a test release on Notion/Substack to confirm structure and visuals work in public.
	3.	Continue with Tiers 5–7 and then the final epilogue reflections.
	4.	Assemble full archive timeline sheet (all editions + all 119 modules mapped) for homepage display.
	5.	Deploy Field Guide and Study Guide once core preservation is stable.
