Module 1 - Filing is Protest
Core Message:
Filing is not simply a request for relief. It is a declaration that the matter exists, that you exist, and that the injust
Lesson Introduction:
In the legal system, silence equals invisibility. Your claims, no matter how legitimate, do not exist in the eyes of
Teaching Block:
1. Filing as Existence - Courts cannot act on what is not in the record.
2. Filing as Leverage - Filing forces the other side and the court to address issues that might otherwise be ignor
3. Filing as Legacy - Even if denied, a well-structured filing becomes part of the permanent record.
Assignment Prompt:
Draft a one-page Notice of Filing that clearly states what you are filing, in which case, and why it matters proced

Module 2 - Format is Memory
Core Message:
The way you format a filing determines whether it becomes a living piece of procedural history - or disappears in
Lesson Introduction:
Think of a legal filing like a medical chart. If the format is wrong, the content won't be read - or worse, it will be c
Teaching Block:
1. Format = Access - A properly formatted filing gets entered into the docket exactly as you wrote it.
2. Format = Memory - Every structured section becomes a data anchor in the court's system.
3. Format as a Strategic Tool - Use formatting to guide the reader to your strongest facts.
Real-World Illustration:
In the SDNY case that vanished from PACER, the formatted TRO motion preserved in PDF still stands as a com

Module 3 – The Docket Is the Battlefield
Core Message:
Your case lives on the docket. If you don’t control it, you’re fighting blind.
Lesson Introduction:
The docket is the procedural battlefield. Judges, clerks, and opposing counsel navigate by docket entries, not b
Teaching Block:
1. The Docket Controls Timing – Deadlines are calculated from docket entries.
2. The Docket Controls Narrative – Filing order frames the story of the case.
3. The Docket as Evidence – Gaps or delays can prove procedural suppression.
Real-World Illustration:
Arizona appellate misclassification created a docket gap that served as proof of constructive denial.
Assignment Prompt:

Model Answer (Sample):

Reflection Summary:
The docket is your battlefield. Play every move.
Visual:
A chessboard morphing into a docket with pieces labeled TRO, Appeal, Exhibit, Order.
Module 4 – Evidence Is Only Evidence If It’s in the Record
Core Message:
Evidence is invisible until it’s filed.
Lesson Introduction:
The court’s record is its only memory. If evidence isn’t in the record, it doesn’t exist procedurally.
Teaching Block:
1. The Record Is Closed – Judges can’t consider unfiled evidence.
2. Filing Makes It Real – Proper filing transforms private proof into procedural fact.
3. The Record as Appeal Lifeline – Missing evidence at trial is missing forever on appeal.
Real-World Illustration:
In the SDNY TRO suppression, timestamped PDFs preserved the fact pattern despite docket disappearance.
Assignment Prompt:
Convert a piece of evidence into a formal exhibit with a label, foundation statement, and mock notice.
Model Answer (Sample):
Exhibit A – July 14, 2025 Court Order. Demonstrates refusal to reclassify appeal, supporting constructive denial

If it’s not in the record, it’s not real.
Visual:
Two drawers — “Official Record” glowing gold, “Unfiled Evidence” fading into dust.
Module 5 – Relief Requested = Relief Possible
Core Message:
Courts can only give you what you ask for.
Lesson Introduction:
Relief must be named clearly and procedurally correctly.
Teaching Block:
1. Name the Relief – Be specific.
2. Fit Relief to Procedure – Match request to legal tool.
3. Relief Shapes Review – No request means no preservation.
Real-World Illustration:
Arizona arbitration case — requesting both TRO and preliminary injunction preserved options on appeal.
Assignment Prompt:
Write a one-sentence relief request for a TRO, an appeal, and a motion to compel.
Model Answer (Sample):
1. TRO: Enjoin enforcement of July 2, 2025 order.
2. Appeal: Reverse July 2, 2025 arbitration order.
3. Compel: Order defendant to produce documents responsive to RFP Nos. 3 and 7.
