# **1) First Principles**

- P1 (Frame): State action → Federal right (14th DP/access) → Causation → Prospective relief (Ex parte Young).
- P2 (Format > Discretion): Filing = protest, format = memory, record = remedy.
- P3 (Preserve): If the judge won’t reach merits, force clean appeal hooks (12(d), notice limits, Rule 52, leave to amend, Rule 58/59).

# **2) Objects (what you always maintain)**

- O1 Proof Pack (per event): Upload receipt/NEF + FedEx delivery + clerk email/minute entry (1 PDF).
- O2 Element Map (1 page): Defendant → Act → Federal deprivation → Ongoing harm → Pin-cite → Narrow remedy.
- O3 Filing Pack (minimal): Notice (preservation) + Proposed Order + NOL/NOF/COS + Cover to AAG.
- O4 False-Evidence Map (table): Item → Quote → Defect (602/802/901/403) → Counter-cite → Remedy (“no reliance”).

# **3) Pipeline (A-B-S)**

- Architect: Choose the smallest viable ask (e.g., “no reliance on Items 1–N”).
- Builder: Generate: Notice, Proposed Order, Maps, Proof Pack.
- Strategist: Insert preservation hooks; remove argument; set timers.

# **4) Quality Gates (pass/fail)**

- QG-1 Non-argumentative: Administrative tone; “NOT A SUR-REPLY” in title.
- QG-2 Preservation Lines present: 12(d) objection; judicial-notice limiter; non-consent + Rule 72; Rule 52(a)(2); Rule 15(a)(2) leave; Rule 58.
- QG-3 Narrow Relief: Prospective, specific (“no reliance on Items 1–N; correct record”).
- QG-4 Timers: 14-day Rule 72; 28-day Rule 59(e); 30-day NOA.

# **5) Decision Tree (MTD/TRO)**

- If 12(b)(6) or 12(b)(1) raised:
    - Disregard extra-pleading or convert under 12(d).
    - If inclined to dismiss → grant leave to amend (FAC cures listed).
- 
- If Younger/abstention:
    - Mitchum exception + bad-faith/taint; relief is prospective.
- 
- If MJ involvement:
    - Non-consent; dispositive → R&R; calendar Rule 72 objections.
- 
- If new authority at arg:
    - Request ≤3-page letter within 3 court days; order transcript; if denied, note objection, later 59(e).

Requested Remedy: “No reliance; strike/limit”

**C) Preservation Footer (paste everywhere)**

Plaintiff objects under Rule 12(d) to extra-pleading materials; if considered, conversion with notice/discovery is required. If other-matter filings are noticed, notice is limited to existence, not truth. Plaintiff does not consent to magistrate jurisdiction; dispositive matters/TRO require district-judge decision or R&R with de novo review. For TRO/PI, Plaintiff requests Rule 52(a)(2) findings. If any deficiency is found, leave to amend under Rule 15(a)(2). Request Rule 58 separate judgment for clarity.

# **How to run LC-M tomorrow (5-minute checklist)**

1. File Notice + Proposed Order (you already have the consolidated pack).
2. Attach NOL/NOF/COS + AAG cover (you have them).
3. Keep Element Map ready; file only if the court invites merits or you need to cleanly anchor issues.
4. Calendar Rule 72 / 59(e) / NOA.
5. Stop. Wait for the court’s move (avoid “vexatious” optics).
