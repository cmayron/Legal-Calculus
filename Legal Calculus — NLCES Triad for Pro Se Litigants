**NLCES triad:** Notion AI Architect → ChatGPT Builder → Gemini Strategist

**Two entry paths to the Strategist:**

- **(A)** Pro se → Architect → Builder → Strategist
- **(B)** Second‑opinion (lawyer draft) → Strategist → Fix‑list → Builder (optional)

---

# 0) Quick‑Start

1. Pick a path below (A or B).
2. Copy the prompt blocks into your tools.
3. Run the Quality Gates before exporting.

---

# 1) The Triad — Roles & Outputs

- **Architect (Notion AI):** turns a user question into a Blueprint (facts, goals, venue, clocks, evidence, risks).
- **Builder (ChatGPT):** turns the Blueprint into filings, checklists, exhibit lists, service packets, and timelines.
- **Strategist (Gemini):** runs a stress test (standards, jurisdiction, service, record sufficiency, likely off‑ramps) and returns a Fix‑List.

## Core artifacts

- Blueprint (from Architect)
- Draft Filing + Proof Packet (from Builder)
- Stress‑Test Report + Fix‑List (from Strategist)

---

# 2) Path A — Pro se → Architect → Builder → Strategist

## Step A1 — Ask Notion AI (Architect) the Question

**Input:** your problem in plain language.

**Output:** a structured Blueprint.

<aside>
**Architect Prompt (paste into Notion AI)**

You are the Architect in the NLCES triad. From the user's question, build a procedural Blueprint:

- Facts (bullet points)
- Objectives (relief sought)
- Jurisdiction & venue (why)
- Posture (stage)
- Clocks (deadlines, service windows)
- Evidence/Exhibits (what exists, what is missing)
- Risks & likely off‑ramps (dismissal/stay/abstention)
- Required outputs for Builder (documents, checklists, timelines)

Return JSON + a human‑readable summary.

</aside>

## Step A2 — Hand Blueprint to ChatGPT (Builder)

**Input:** Blueprint JSON + summary.

**Output:** Draft filing(s), service plan, exhibit index, timeline, QC checklist.

<aside>
**Builder Prompt (paste into ChatGPT)**

You are the Builder in the NLCES triad. Use the Blueprint to produce:

1. Draft filing(s) with caption, jurisdictional statement, facts, claims/relief, signature blocks.
2. Service packet: who, how, when; include certificates of service.
3. Exhibit index with labels and proof items.
4. Timeline with required dates and reminders.
5. QC checklist mapped to the Quality Gates below.

Return as: (a) DOCX-ready text, (b) a copy-paste Notion block, and (c) a fix‑me list of open items.

</aside>

## Step A3 — Send Draft to Gemini (Strategist)

**Input:** Draft filing + QC checklist.

**Output:** Stress‑Test Report + prioritized Fix‑List.

<aside>
**Strategist Prompt (paste into Gemini)**

You are the Strategist. Run a hard stress test on the draft:

- Standards: is the requested relief supported by the correct standard?
- Jurisdiction/Venue: defects, alternatives, removal/abstention risks.
- Service/Notice: method, timing, proof sufficiency.
- Record sufficiency: exhibits, verification, certifications, affidavits.
- Procedure: formatting, page limits, required forms, filing method.
- Risk table: likely off‑ramps and mitigations.

Return (1) a scored Stress‑Test Report and (2) a Fix‑List with exact edits.

</aside>

## Step A4 — Apply Fix‑List in ChatGPT (Builder)

**Output:** Filing v2 + updated proof packet + final QC pass.

---

# 3) Path B — Second‑Opinion (lawyer draft) → Strategist

**Step B1 —** Input: the lawyer's filing (PDF/DOCX) + docket context.

**Step B2 —** Strategist Stress‑Test (Gemini) using the same prompt as above; add:

- Compare to controlling standards and local rules.
- Identify omissions (service, exhibits, affidavits, proposed order).
- Suggest precise patch text and citations.

**Step B3 —** Optional Builder Pass (ChatGPT) to implement the patch list and produce a clean redline + final.

## Stress‑Test Matrix (use as a checklist)

| **Gate** | **Status** |
| --- | --- |
| Rules/Standards | ✓/✗ |
| Venue/Jurisdiction | ✓/✗ |
| Timelines/Clocks | ✓/✗ |
| Service/Notice | ✓/✗ |
| Record/Exhibits | ✓/✗ |
| Relief/Remedies | ✓/✗ |
| Formatting/Local Forms | ✓/✗ |
| Off‑ramps/Risks → Mitigations | ✓/✗ |

# 4) Modes

## Education Mode — Advanced LCa (Lawyer Calculus)

- **Goal:** teach the why behind each gate.
- **Tools:** mini‑cases, before/after filings, quizzes, model answers.
- **Outputs:** lesson pages, a Study Guide mapping "Assignment → Model Answer."

## Coalition Mode — Collaborative (Notion AI‑first)

- **Goal:** team drafting and peer review.
- **Tools:** shared Notion DBs, role tags, assignment queue.
- **Outputs:** pooled Blueprints, shared exhibit library, community checklists.

# 6) Quality Gates (run before any filing)

1. **Caption & Signature** — correct court, parties, signature/verification done.
2. **Standard & Relief** — correct test stated and applied.
3. **Jurisdiction & Venue** — pled and supported.
4. **Service & Notice** — method, timing, certificate prepared.
5. **Record** — exhibits labeled, referenced, and attached; proposed order included.
6. **Formatting** — page limits, fonts, margins, local forms, e‑file rules.
7. **Timeline** — all clocks calendared; follow‑up tasks assigned.

---

# 7) Export Targets

- DOCX/PDF (court‑ready)
- Notion Blocks (archive/teaching)
- Checklist CSV (for reminders)
- Redline/Final Pair (for second‑opinion path)

---

# 8) Sustainability (light nudge)

- Book a weekly 45‑minute co‑work slot with a clinic buddy/friend to run one Blueprint through the gates.
- Consider a therapist‑as‑coach check‑in during high‑stress phases; it keeps the work sharp and the mind steady.
