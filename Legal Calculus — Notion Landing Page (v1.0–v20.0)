# **📘 Welcome**

Legal Calculus is a modular, public procedural system for filing when courts deny, erase, or suppress.

Created by Charles Mayron, MD, FACS, Legal Calculus teaches:

- How to format survival into memory
- How to file after access is denied
- How to turn structure into shared signal

# “I did not intentionally break the rules of a game I never played. We approached it logically — and that was the problem.”
