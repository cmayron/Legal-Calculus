## What Legal Calculus Is

Legal Calculus is an open-source educational system designed to teach procedural literacy to people who need to navigate the legal system on their own terms.

<aside>
**Core Philosophy:** "Filing is protest. Format is memory. The record is the remedy."

</aside>

- **Comprehensive curriculum:** 119+ modules across multiple tiers, plus a 1,000-entry Field Guide
- **Free and open:** Available on GitHub, Notion, Substack, LinkedIn, and Google Classroom
- **Transparently AI-assisted:** Built collaboratively with ChatGPT (GPT-4/5), openly disclosed
- **Licensed for sharing:** Creative Commons (CC BY-NC-SA)
- **Multiple learning modes:** Crisis Mode for urgent filings, Educator Mode for clinics, Second-Opinion Mode for review

External validation from Gemini AI characterized it as "a people's law school in modular form" that "could redefine legal education the way open-source redefined computing."

## Why It's Not Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL)

### 1. It's Educational, Not Representational

Legal Calculus explicitly states it provides **"not legal advice"** but rather **"a public educational toolkit."** It teaches people how to use procedures they have the legal right to use themselves—it doesn't practice law on anyone's behalf.

> "Not legal advice. This is a public educational toolkit. Use it to structure filings, spot issues, and build the record."
> 

### 2. It's Built for Access to Justice

The system operates on the principle that **"justice shouldn't require privilege."** It's specifically designed for:

- **People who cannot afford lawyers:** No paywalls, completely free access
- **Pro se litigants:** Those representing themselves by choice or necessity
- **People facing structural disadvantages:** Teaching procedural literacy from the ground up

### 3. It Empowers Individual Rights

Every person has the constitutional right to represent themselves (pro se). Legal Calculus teaches people how to exercise that right effectively by:

- Understanding procedural rules and requirements
- Formatting documents correctly
- Preserving the record for appeal
- Building documentation of systemic issues

### 4. It Creates Public Record for Systemic Change

Beyond individual cases, Legal Calculus serves a broader democratic function:

- **Documentation:** Creating records of procedural barriers and judicial conduct
- **Advocacy:** Building evidence for judicial reform and legislative change
- **Coalition building:** When individual formatting becomes collective knowledge
- **Democratic participation:** Making legal procedures transparent and accessible

> "Legal Calculus shifts power from institutions to the public."

### 5. It Includes Clear Warnings and Responsibilities

The system emphasizes user responsibility:

<aside>
**Disclaimer:** "AI is powerful but imperfect. Users must edit, verify, and take responsibility for filings."

</aside>

Users are taught to:

- Validate citations with independent sources
- Edit and customize templates for their specific circumstances
- Understand the limitations of AI-generated content
- Take full responsibility for what they file

## The Distinction That Matters

### Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL)

- Representing someone else
- Giving specific legal advice
- Acting as an attorney
- Creating attorney-client relationships
- Charging for legal services without a license

### Legal Education (Legal Calculus)

- Teaching self-representation skills
- Providing general procedural education
- Empowering individual rights
- Offering free educational resources
- Building public knowledge infrastructure

## Two Complementary Purposes

### Purpose 1: Immediate Access for Individual Litigants

For people who cannot afford legal representation or choose to represent themselves, Legal Calculus provides:

- Step-by-step procedural guidance
- Templates and checklists
- Crisis mode for urgent filings
- Model answers and examples
- Strategic understanding of court procedures

### Purpose 2: Building the Record for Systemic Change

Beyond individual cases, the system creates lasting documentation:

- **Legislative advocacy:** Documented patterns of access barriers inform policy reform
- **Judicial accountability:** Preserved records of procedural suppression and judicial conduct
- **Public education:** Making hidden legal processes visible and understandable
- **Collective knowledge:** Shared procedural strategies become common resources
- **Democratic infrastructure:** Open-source legal education as a public good

<aside>
**The Power of the Record:** Even when individual cases don't achieve immediate justice, the documented record becomes evidence for systemic reform and future legislative action.

## Conclusion

Legal Calculus exists at the intersection of education, empowerment, and advocacy. It teaches people how to exercise their constitutional right to represent themselves while simultaneously creating a public archive that can inform broader legal reform.

It's not practicing law—it's democratizing legal knowledge. It's not circumventing the system—it's making the system's own rules accessible to everyone.
