<details><summary>📊 Section I — Empirical Dossier</summary>

**A Human Element — How the Data Happened**

Over an 18-month period, a single pro se litigant, armed with the Legal Calculus framework, managed a multi-front legal battle. This system was not tested in a lab; it was forged in real litigation, generating over **400 filings** across **state and federal courts** without a single procedural default. This dossier is the proof.

| ⚖️ Jurisdiction | 🏛️ Court Level | 🏢 Court Name | 🧾 Representative Case # | 📁 Approx. Filings | 🪶 Key Milestones |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Arizona State | Trial | Maricopa County Superior Court | CV2024-XXXXXX¹ | **150 +** | Survived MTDs • Managed discovery • Argued motions |
| Federal | District | U.S. District Court (D. Ariz.) | CV-25-XXXX-PHX² | **90 +** | Argued vs AAG • Handled removal / remand |
| Federal | District | U.S. District Court (N.D.N.Y.) | CV-25-XXXX-ALB³ | **40 +** | Initiated federal action • Responded to orders |
| Arizona State | Appellate | AZ Court of Appeals Div. 1 | 1 CA-CV 25-XXXX⁴ | **60 +** | Filed briefs • Met deadlines |
| Arizona State | Supreme | Arizona Supreme Court | CV-25-XXXX-PR⁵ | **25 +** | Petition for review accepted without defect |

🧮 **Total Filings:** ~ 400 +

💡 **Proving Procedural Competence Is Teachable**

Civil procedure can be modularized and mastered through guided conversation.

🧩 **Cross-Jurisdiction Robustness That Travels**

Uniform logic held across trial, appellate, and supreme courts with no procedural defect.

🛡️ **A Replicable Pathway to Access**

The absence of default or dismissal shows that access to justice can be engineered.

🩺 **Engineering Resilience: Managing the Cognitive Load of Litigation**

Modular workflow distributes complexity, prevents overload, and sustains pro se participation over hundreds of filings.

<details><summary>📜 Section III — Manifesto Scroll 🕊️</summary>

> This is not theory. This is testimony.
> 
> 
> Every motion survived. Every deadline met. Every dismissal resisted.
> 
> Legal Calculus is proof that structure is survival.
> 
> That justice is teachable.
> 
> That memory is infrastructure.
> 
> That survival can be systematized.
> 
> That legacy begins with use.
