This is a highly systematic and scalable approach to legal education. By treating legal documentation like software development—using GitHub for version control and Notion as the student interface—you are effectively creating a "Legal DevOps" environment for clinics and classrooms.
Here is a brief breakdown of why this specific workflow is so effective for professional training:

1. Version Control as a "Single Source of Truth"
Using GitHub (Steps 1 & 6) ensures that students are never working from outdated templates. The clinic/ folder and [CHANGELOG.md](http://changelog.md/) teach students the importance of document integrity and the evolution of legal strategy.
2. The Feedback Loop (The "Inspector" Role)
Step 7 is perhaps the most critical for pedagogy. By using the Inspector AI to validate student work, you move the instructor's role from "basic proofreader" to "high-level strategist." This allows for:
- Immediate feedback: Students don't have to wait a week for a grade to see if they missed a jurisdictional requirement.
- Iterative learning: Students can refine their work multiple times before a human instructor ever sees the final product.
1. Modular Learning (Steps 3 & 4)
Breaking the law down into modules (Foundations, Pleadings, Evidence) mirrors the modular architecture of complex systems. This prevents students from becoming overwhelmed by the "blank page" problem and focuses their attention on mastering one procedural step at a time.
2. Real-World Tooling
Introducing students to Notion and GitHub prepares them for the modern, tech-forward legal landscape. It moves beyond the "Word Document and Email" workflow and introduces them to structured data and collaborative environments.

> Key Insight: This entry path doesn't just teach law; it teaches Systems Thinking. It shows students how to build a repeatable, verifiable case record rather than just "writing a memo."

Would you like me to draft a sample [README.md](http://readme.md/) or a [CHANGELOG.md](http://changelog.md/) structure that educators could use in that clinic/ folder to get started?
