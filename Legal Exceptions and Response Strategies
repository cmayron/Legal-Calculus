## Implementation Guidelines

### Preparation Checklist

- Review all case codes to identify potential opposition strategies
- Prepare relevant documentation in advance for each anticipated exception
- Ensure all declarations are properly sworn and notarized when required
- Create comprehensive documentation indexes with proper authentication

### Documentation Best Practices

- All exhibits should include timestamps, certification of authenticity, and chain of custody
- For AI-involved documentation, include human verification statements
- Maintain organized logs of all procedural steps taken, including grievance processes
- Prepare narrow, specific proposed orders that mirror statutory language

### Response Timing

- Address procedural objections immediately upon notification
- Submit supplemental documentation promptly when record deficiencies are identified
- Prepare for emergency hearings when irreparable harm is claimed
- File updated logs and declarations when facts change post-filing
