This is a profound pivot. You are moving away from "Legal Idealism" (how the books say it works) toward "Legal Realism" (how the power dynamics actually function).
You’ve identified two hidden algorithms that dictate the life of a case: Judicial Calculus and Lawyer Calculus. These are often invisible to the client, leading to a sense of betrayal when the lawyer "decides" for you behind closed doors.
🧠 The Dual Calculus Model
In the People’s Law School, we teach students to read these hidden math problems so they can anticipate the moves of the professionals.

| Concept | The Traditional "Lie" | The "Realist" Calculus (The Truth) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Judicial Calculus | The judge objectively weighs facts against the law to find "Justice." | The judge weighs Efficiency + Precedent + Political Risk. They want to clear their docket without being overturned on appeal. |
| Lawyer Calculus | The lawyer fights zealously for every inch of the client’s rights. | The lawyer weighs Billable Hours vs. Career Longevity. They won't burn a bridge with a judge or a colleague for one client's case. |
| 🛠 Module: Decoding the "Backroom" Decision |  |  |
| This module focuses on Outcome-Based Evidence. Instead of asking "What is my right?" we ask "What is the lawyer’s incentive?" |  |  |
1. The Real-Time Transparency Check (The "Patch")
Since lawyers often decide for you rather than with you, we create a "Verification Protocol."
- The "Reasoning" Demand: Before a hearing, the litigant issues a written instruction: "Explain the specific trade-offs of this strategy in writing."
- The Goal: To force the "Lawyer Calculus" out of their head and onto the record.
1. Evidence-Based Law vs. Narrative-Based Law
Lawyers love "narrative" because it's negotiable. The People's Law School focuses on Evidence-Based Law—the "hard code" that is harder for lawyers to trade away in backroom deals.
- The Immutability Factor: We teach litigants to anchor their case in evidence that cannot be "lawyered away" during a casual chat between opposing counsels.
1. Strategic Autonomy Rituals
When the lawyer says, "Trust me, this is for the best," the curriculum provides the counter-script:
- The Redirect: "Help me understand how this decision aligns with the specific judicial calculus of this particular judge. What is the risk of the alternative?"
⚖️ Judicial Calculus: The "Out-of-Court" Reality
You mentioned focusing on the outcome rather than the ideal. In the real world, the "Outcome" is often decided by Systemic Friction:
- Is the judge tired?
- Does the lawyer have another trial starting tomorrow?
- Is the court clerk annoyed with the filing style?
Our curriculum treats these "frictions" as Variables (x, y, z) in an equation, rather than as "unfairness" to be mourned.
What should we encode next?
If we are building this "Small Language Model" for empowerment, we need to define the "Red Lines." These are the moments where "Lawyer Calculus" becomes "Legal Malpractice" or "Breach of Fiduciary Duty."
