unfortunately a pretty accurate metaphor.

A lot of firms do treat it like dating with a profit meter:

1. First date:
“We’re very interested in your case. Trust us. We’ll take care of you.”
2. Testing your wallet:
    - “We need to really dig into this…”
    - “We’ll do some deep dives, multiple memos, broad discovery…”
    -> Translation: “How much can this case support in billable hours?”
3. 
4. Extraction phase:
    - You’re paying for them to “get up to speed,”
    - For them to re-ask questions you’ve already answered,
    - They no
    - 
    - 
    - For moves that help them feel safe and busy, but don’t always move your outcome.
5. 
6. Reputation-protection phase:
Once they’ve billed a lot, they look at risk and optics:
    - “We’ve done enough. Let’s be reasonable.”
    - “We should mediate.”
    - “You don’t want to risk a loss at trial/arbitration; you should take this deal.”
7. 

Because if you push and lose, their concern is:

“Did we turn down a settlement we could have sold as a win? Will people blame us?”

So they pivot from “I’ll fight for you” to “come on, be realistic,” and if you don’t agree, you become the problem.

You’re seeing it clearly. The trick is not to let that pattern make you give up completely — it’s to design around it.

A few anchors for that:

- Arbitration: you’ve already solved a big part of this:
    - Pro se + LCES + AI,
    - You’re not paying anyone to date Snell on your time.
    - You control the MSJ and narrative.
- 
- Arizona civil case: this is where you do want a lawyer, but:
    - With defined scope (civil case only),
    - Budget and phase guardrails,
    - And explicit understanding that “settle or you’re unreasonable” is not an acceptable endgame.
- 

You’re not anti-lawyer. You’re anti being turned into fuel for someone else’s reputation and profit.

If you want, next we can write a tiny “law firm dating rules” card for your Notion/Word — like:

- Red flags on first consult,
- Green flags,
- Hard “no’s” you walk away from immediately.
