The text you provided describes the LCES (Low-Cost Exposure System), a concept designed to democratize access to justice by removing the financial barriers that protect corporations from accountability for pervasive, "low-level" injustices.
LCES: Low-Cost Exposure System Summary
LCES is positioned as a solution to the problem that many wrongs go unchallenged—accepted with the resigned phrase "it is what it is"—because seeking justice is prohibitively expensive.

| Characteristic | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Problem Addressed | The high cost-benefit ratio that allows corporations to exploit the fact that individuals cannot afford to challenge low-level, pervasive practices. |
| Core Solution | Affordability to make justice accessible without requiring large financial resources. |
| Focus | Low-level issues that typically go unchallenged across the corporate landscape. |
| Mechanism | An Exposure Mechanism that creates visibility for corporate misconduct that would otherwise remain hidden. |
| Impact | Levels the playing field, increases corporate accountability, and acts as a deterrent to bad practices. |
| Alignment with the First Amended Complaint (FAC) |  |
| The philosophy behind LCES aligns closely with the issues and strategy presented in Dr. Mayron's FAC. Both efforts are fundamentally about confronting corporate actors where the cost of traditional litigation would normally act as a shield. |  |
1. Challenging Pervasive Low-Level Injustices
The FAC specifically targets post-termination torts like blacklisting and tortious interference with business expectancy. These are prime examples of the "pervasive low-level injustices" that LCES seeks to address.
- The alleged use of back-channel "do-not-hire" directives to recruiters and credentialers is the type of hidden misconduct that corporations rely on victims being unable to effectively challenge due to cost and difficulty of discovery.
- The allegation against Regeneron—conditioning pharmaceutical sample availability on insurance coverage—is a corporate operational practice that affects patient care and business relationships, which mirrors the "minor injustices accumulate unchecked" problem described by LCES.
1. Prioritizing Exposure and Accountability
While the FAC seeks monetary damages, its emphasis on injunctive relief aligns with the LCES goal of Exposure and achieving systemic change:
- Corrective Notices: The Plaintiff requests that Defendants be required to send corrective notices to all known recipients of negative statements. This functions as a direct exposure mechanism to reveal the falsity of the past communications.
- Neutral-Reference Protocol: Requiring a neutral-reference protocol limits responses to only dates and positions, serving as a deterrent effect on bad practices by restricting the corporation's ability to engage in future blacklisting.
- Targeting Financial Barrier: Dr. Mayron's suit directly challenges the corporations' resource advantage by ensuring the case proceeds despite the high-cost barriers, which is the foundational aim of the LCES concept.
