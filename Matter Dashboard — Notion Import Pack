Matter Dashboard — Notion Import Pack
====================================

This ZIP contains four CSV templates to spin up your Matter Dashboard in Notion:

1) MatterDashboard_Issues.csv      → Master Issues List
2) MatterDashboard_Exhibits.csv    → Exhibit Registry
3) MatterDashboard_Service.csv     → Service Matrix
4) MatterDashboard_Quality.csv     → Quality Bar Scorecard

Quick Start (Notion)
--------------------
1. In Notion: / → “Table – Full page” → “Import” → choose CSV.
2. Import each CSV as its own database (Issues, Exhibits, Service, Quality).
3. Add relations:
   • Issues ↔ Exhibits (Where Cited)
   • Issues ↔ Service (Linked Issue)
   • Issues ↔ Quality (Filing ID or Issue)
4. Add views:
   • Issues: Timeline (by Deadline), Risks (P0), This Week
   • Exhibits: Uncited filter (Where Cited is empty)
   • Service: Upcoming (Date Served empty), Proof Log (gallery)
   • Quality: Open Gaps (unchecked items)

Tips
----
• Keep exhibit hashes (SHA-256) in the registry; store originals and annotated copies.
• Use consistent naming: YYYY-MM-DD_doc-type_vX_author.docx
• Schedule Daily Ritual (10 min) + Weekly Retro (15 min) as calendar views.
• Invite an “ops buddy” to your workspace for light accountability.
