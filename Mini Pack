The Filing Trap

■■ Core Message

Filing alone isn’t enough. If format, caption, and title aren’t precise, the court may treat your

filing as if it never existed.

■ Lesson Content

- The Illusion of Filing: Clerks can mark filings 'received but not filed' or label them 'letters.'

- The Power of Titles: Judges act on categories ('Notice', 'Motion'), not stories.

- Captions as Anchors: Correct court, case number, and parties force recognition.

- Format as Shield: Paragraphing and service proof convert paper into record.

■ Assignment

Draft a 1–2 page mock filing with caption, procedural title, numbered paragraphs, and

Certificate of Service.

■ Reflection Summary

Filing ≠ Memory. Caption + Title = Survival.

The Service Illusion

■■ Core Message

■ Assignment

Draft a Certificate of Service including document title, method, recipients, signature, and date.

■ Reflection Summary

Notice is not enough. Proof is protection. Certificate of Service = Memory.

■ Lesson Content

- Clerk Delay as Denial: Days of delay make filings appear late.

- Carrier Confusion: Some courts only honor USPS postmarks.

- How to Protect Yourself: Keep proof, cite the rule, document obstruction.

■ Assignment

Draft a Notice of Timely Filing by Mail citing date, method, proof, and clerk delay.

■ Reflection Summary

Mailing ≠ Filing. Carriers ≠ Equal. Delay documented becomes evidenc
