Module 42: Ignoring Ex parte Young — Immunity by Evasion
⚖️ Core Message
When courts ignore Ex parte Young, they allow defendants to cloak constitutional violations in the shield of sovereign immunity. The law provides a pathway for relief — but judicial silence closes it.

📖 Teaching Block
- The 11th Amendment Argument: Defendants often assert that any suit involving state officials is a suit 'against the State,' invoking sovereign immunity.
- The Carve-Out: Ex parte Young (1908) holds that state officials can be sued in their official capacities for prospective relief to stop ongoing constitutional violations.
- Judicial Avoidance: Instead of engaging, some judges omit any discussion of Ex parte Young, effectively siding with the defense through silence.
- The Effect: Constitutional claims are blocked not by law, but by judicial evasion of controlling precedent.

"They said I was suing the State. I said: Ex parte Young. The Court said nothing."

📝 Assignment
Task: Draft a procedural memorandum highlighting a court’s failure to address Ex parte Young when immunity was raised.

Instructions:
1. Quote the defendant’s argument invoking sovereign immunity.
2. Quote your reply invoking Ex parte Young.
3. Note the Court’s omission of the precedent.
4. Conclude: “Judicial silence cannot erase binding precedent.”

✅ Model Response
“In response to Defendants’ assertion of sovereign immunity under the 11th Amendment, Plaintiff cited Ex parte Young, which expressly authorizes suits against state officials in their official capacity for ongoing violations of federal law. The Court’s order did not address Ex parte Young at all. By omitting discussion of controlling Supreme Court authority, the Court effectively granted immunity by evasion, rather than by application of law. Judicial silence cannot erase binding precedent.”

📌 Reflection
The refusal to acknowledge Ex parte Young is not error by accident — it is error by design. Courts preserve institutional safety by omitting precedent that would force them to confront state actors. This is how silence becomes the ruling.
