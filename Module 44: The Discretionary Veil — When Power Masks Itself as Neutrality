Module 44: The Discretionary Veil — When Power Masks Itself as Neutrality
⚖️ Core Message
Judicial discretion is often framed as neutral authority, but in practice it becomes a veil that hides power choices. Courts invoke “discretion” not to balance fairness, but to protect themselves from accountability.

📖 Teaching Block
- The Neutral Mask: Discretion is presented as flexibility, but it conceals structural bias.
- The Escape Hatch: When law compels a result judges want to avoid, they declare it a “matter of discretion.”
- The Veil Effect: By labeling decisions as discretionary, judges shield themselves from appellate scrutiny and public accountability.
- For Pro Se Litigants: This veil is used most aggressively against the unrepresented, where courts rely on the narrative that “the judge has wide latitude.”

"Discretion isn’t neutrality. Discretion is camouflage."

📝 Assignment
Task: Identify a moment when a judge invoked “discretion” in your case.

Instructions:
1. Quote the specific ruling or transcript line where discretion was invoked.
2. Identify the law or precedent that discretion sidestepped.
3. Conclude: “Discretion functioned as a veil — not as fairness.”

✅ Model Response
“The Court struck my supplemental reply stating, ‘The decision whether to allow such filings lies within the Court’s discretion.’ Yet Rule 15 explicitly permits supplemental pleadings with leave of court when justice so requires. The invocation of discretion served not as neutrality, but as a veil to block procedural fairness. Discretion functioned as a veil — not as fairness.”

📌 Reflection
The discretionary veil is how power hides itself. By documenting every instance, litigants can show that what is presented as neutral authority is often a shield for systemic denial.
