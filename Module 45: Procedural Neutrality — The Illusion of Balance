Module 45: Procedural Neutrality — The Illusion of Balance
⚖️ Core Message
Courts often frame their rulings as procedurally neutral — claiming they are simply “following the rules.” But neutrality is not balance when the procedure is selectively applied. What appears as equal enforcement can conceal unequal burdens.

📖 Teaching Block
- The Neutrality Claim: Judges present decisions as “neutral application of procedure.”
- Selective Enforcement: Neutrality is undermined when courts strictly enforce rules against pro se litigants while bending them for represented parties.
- The Illusion of Balance: By appearing to treat both sides equally, the court disguises asymmetry of impact.
- The Result: Procedural neutrality becomes a rhetorical tool to justify unfair outcomes.

"Neutrality isn’t balance. Neutrality is performance."

📝 Assignment
Task: Identify one procedural ruling in your case that was presented as neutral but operated against you disproportionately.

Instructions:
1. Quote the judge’s explanation invoking neutrality (e.g., “The same rules apply to all parties”).
2. Show how the rule was selectively enforced.
3. Conclude: “Neutrality here was performance, not balance.”

✅ Model Response
“The Court stated that deadlines apply equally to all parties, denying Plaintiff’s filing as untimely. Yet Defendants’ own late submissions were accepted without sanction. Neutrality here was performance, not balance.”

📌 Reflection
Neutrality is not measured by rhetoric but by effect. For pro se litigants, neutrality is often invoked as a shield for imbalance. Documenting the illusion of balance exposes neutrality as performance, not justice.
