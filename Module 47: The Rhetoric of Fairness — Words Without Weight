Module 47: The Rhetoric of Fairness — Words Without Weight
⚖️ Core Message
Courts frequently use the language of fairness — assuring litigants they are “heard,” “considered,” or “treated equally.” But this rhetoric is often empty. When outcomes are predetermined, fairness becomes a performance, not a practice.

📖 Teaching Block
- The Language Shield: Judges employ fairness rhetoric (“your arguments have been carefully reviewed”) even when rulings ignore key evidence.
- Performance over Practice: The use of fairness words is designed to deflect criticism and maintain legitimacy.
- Impact on Pro Se Litigants: For the unrepresented, the rhetoric of fairness provides cover for dismissals that never actually engaged their filings.
- Key Distinction: True fairness engages substance; rhetorical fairness disguises avoidance.

"Fairness said. Fairness not done."

📝 Assignment
Task: Identify where a judge used fairness rhetoric in your case.

Instructions:
1. Quote the fairness language (e.g., “the Court has considered all filings”).
2. Identify the evidence or precedent that was omitted despite the claim.
3. Conclude: “Fairness here was rhetoric, not reality.”

✅ Model Response
“The Court stated it had reviewed ‘all submissions by the parties.’ Yet the order made no mention of Plaintiff’s constitutional claims under Christopher v. Harbury. Fairness here was rhetoric, not reality.”

📌 Reflection
The rhetoric of fairness is a mask courts wear to protect institutional legitimacy. Documenting the difference between words and actions is key to exposing how fairness is invoked as a symbol, not a standard.
