Module 52: Mootness by Delay — Justice Timed Out
⚖️ Core Message
Courts can deny urgent relief without saying no by simply waiting. When the event passes, the request is declared moot. Delay becomes the dispositive ruling. Timing is a doctrine — and a weapon.

📖 Teaching Block
- Calendar control: Judges control time. Postponements, late docketing, and deferred rulings can convert a live controversy into a non-issue.
- TRO/PI decay: Emergency relief has a half-life. If the court waits, the harm occurs, then the court calls it moot.
- Anti‑mootness doctrines: (1) capable of repetition yet evading review; (2) voluntary cessation; (3) collateral consequences; (4) relation‑back for time‑sensitive claims. Use them to keep relief alive.
- Preserve the clock: Build a dated timeline of filings, service, requests for expedition, and the court’s delays. Ask for explicit rulings on expedition, status, and preservation orders (e.g., stay of hearing).
- Procedural levers: motion to expedite; motion to stay/maintain status quo; notice of imminent mootness; petition for extraordinary relief to compel a timely ruling.

"Delay is a decision. Mootness by delay is denial without reasons."

📝 Assignment
Task: Draft an Anti‑Mootness Preservation Memo.

Instructions:
1. Create a dated timeline showing when you filed (TRO/PI/request), when the opposing event was scheduled, and when the court acted.
2. Identify the points where delay made relief impossible and note each request you made for expedition or status.
3. Write a 2–3 paragraph argument invoking at least one anti‑mootness doctrine (capable of repetition, voluntary cessation, collateral consequences, relation‑back) and request an order preserving the status quo or expedited decision.
4. Conclude with a specific ask (e.g., stay of hearing, accelerated ruling, or instruction that the claim is not moot due to evasion of review).

✅ Model Response
“Plaintiff filed a TRO on July 29 seeking to stay an August 15 administrative hearing. The Court deferred decision until after the hearing date passed. Defendants now argue the request is moot. But the issue is capable of repetition yet evading review: the same hearing process recurs on short notice and consistently terminates before judicial review is possible. Alternatively, the agency’s last‑minute pauses and restarts constitute voluntary cessation that does not moot the controversy. The Court should grant expedited relief and maintain the status quo, or clarify that the claim is not moot and proceed to the merits.”

📌 Reflection
Justice is temporal as much as legal. If you don’t document and contest delay, the clock becomes the ruling. Treat time as part of your record and your argument.
