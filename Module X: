**See Something, Say Nothing – The Club’s New Normal**

Core idea:

On paper, healthcare says: If you see something, say something.

In practice, the club says: If you see something, say nothing. Look the other way.

This is the new normal in many systems:

- Patient safety is espoused, not enforced.
    - Policy manuals, mission statements, and quality posters all say “safety first.”
    - But when safety conflicts with revenue, loyalty, or “team culture,” safety drops to last.
- 
- Silence is rewarded, advocacy is punished.
    - The clinician who quietly signs the compliance training and keeps moving is “a good fit.”
    - The clinician who actually insists on following the standard of care, documenting harm, and escalating real problems becomes “difficult,” “not a cultural match,” “the interpersonal issue.”
- 
- Cover-up ≠ neutral; it is an enabling act.
    - Looking the other way doesn’t just fail to stop bad behavior.
    - It enables it, by teaching everyone else that speaking up is dangerous and silence is safe.
- 

Legal Calculus calls this the Club Reflex:

When confronted with danger or deviation, the reflex is to protect the group, not the patient, and to remove the person who breaks the silence rather than the behavior that caused the harm.

Your DH case is a concrete example:

- A monocular patient goes blind after basic retinal precautions are skipped.
- You raise it.
- The Board later confirms the care was substandard.
- The system’s main reaction to you: “You’re the problem.”

In Legal Calculus, we don’t pretend this is a glitch. We treat it as standard operating procedure that must be documented and confronted.

**Reflection / Assignment (LC Style)**

1. Map the Reflex:
    - Identify one case (real or hypothetical) where “see something, say nothing” operated.
    - List:
        - What was seen.
        - Who saw it.
        - What should have happened.
        - What actually happened.
        - How silence or cover-up enabled repeat harm.
    -

3. Reframe the Narrative:
    - Write two one-line versions of the story:
        - The Club Version: “We had to deal with a difficult doctor.”
        - The Legal Calculus Version: “We removed the doctor who refused to look away when a patient was being harmed.”
    -

5. Procedural Move:
    - Draft a one-paragraph statement you would put into a complaint, arbitration brief, or Board response that:
        - Names the patient-safety issue.
        - Names the retaliation.
        - States plainly: “Covering this up enabled ongoing harm.”
