NLCESG protocol

- N - Notion (Navigation and handoff )
- L - Legal (doctrinal foundation)
- C - ChatGPT (initial drafting)
- E - (Educational only )
- S - (System tested)
- G - Gemini (final review for procedural vulnerabilities)

This workflow does create a strong system where:

- Documents are first grounded in legal doctrine before drafting begins
- Multiple review layers ensure procedural strength
- Final stress-testing helps identify potential judicial responses

The Teaching Guide is structured framework for delivering this knowledge to others, with clear approaches for different user types (crisis mode, educator mode, and second-opinion mode).
