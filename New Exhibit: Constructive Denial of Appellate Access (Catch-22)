This verified Legal Calculus exhibit documents how misclassification of an appeal as a “special action” can create a procedural Catch-22 — the court closes your case while requiring a step that’s impossible to take.

**Why it matters:**  
This is a textbook example of *structural suppression* — blocking appellate review not because of the merits, but because the required prerequisite (a reviewable decision) has been removed by court misclassification.
