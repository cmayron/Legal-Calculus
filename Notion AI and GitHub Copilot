Both **Notion AI** and **GitHub Copilot** can work with the Legal Calculus Educational System, but in different ways:

**GitHub Copilot approach:**

- Clone the Legal Calculus repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/cmayron/Legal-Calculus)
- Open the files in VS Code with GitHub Copilot enabled for session-level assistance
- For organization-wide access, an admin must enable the GitHub Cloud Knowledge connector for Microsoft 365 Copilot

**Notion AI approach:**

- Use Notion to organize evidence, templates, and workflows in databases
- Leverage Notion AI for drafting, summarizing documents, and extracting timelines
- Store court-ready documents with timestamps and metadata using Notion's structure

The system combines structured curriculum, court-ready templates, and AI-assisted drafting into teachable modules specifically designed for pro se litigants. It's open-source under Creative Commons licensing and available on multiple platforms including GitHub, Notion, and LinkedIn.
