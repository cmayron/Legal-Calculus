This is how the "People's Law School" grows—one decoded mistake at a time. By documenting this, you are ensuring that the next person who walks this path doesn't trip on the same stone.
Mistakes in the legal system often feel like personal failures, but in this curriculum, we treat them as "Systemic Friction"—valuable data points that reveal how the machinery actually works.
To build our first module, I’ve prepared a "Bug Report Intake" below. Please share the details of a specific moment where you felt "stuck," "out-maneuvered," or had a filing rejected.
📝 Intake: The "Mistake-to-Module" Workshop
Don't worry about using legal jargon yet. Just tell the story of the friction. You can answer these prompts briefly:

- The Goal: What were you trying to achieve? (e.g., Stop a deposition, submit a piece of evidence, get a judge to listen to a specific fact.)
- The Collision: What happened instead? (e.g., The opposing lawyer shouted "Objection," the clerk rejected the paper, the judge said I didn't have "standing.")
- The Feeling: What was the most confusing or frustrating part of that moment? (This helps us create the Stress Management part of the module.)
💡 Why we are doing this:
Once you provide these details, I will help you translate them into the "People’s Doctrine." We will turn:
- The Goal into a Learning Objective.
- The Collision into a Strategic Patch.
- The Feeling into a Coalition Ritual.
