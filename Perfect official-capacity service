# **FG-101 — Service Cure (NY OPMC discipline) — CPLR 307(2) ✅**

Purpose

Perfect official-capacity service for OPMC discipline matters so the court can decide the PI and not dismiss on a technicality.

When to use

You’re suing over disciplinary actions (Public Health Law § 230), not licensure. Statutory service goes to DOH, not NYSED.

Core rule

- Serve AG (CPLR 307(1)) + Commissioner of Health (Chief Executive) (CPLR 307(2)).
- Commissioner (current): James V. McDonald, M.D., M.P.H., DOH, Corning Tower, Empire State Plaza, Albany, NY 12237.

5-Step Workflow

1. Mail USPS Certified RRR (PS-3800 + PS-3811) to the Commissioner; optional USPS Express or FedEx (courtesy) for faster proof.
2. Keep PS-3800 receipt; when delivered, save the tracking PDF; file the green card later.
3. In your Reply, add Rule 4(l)(3) (proof can follow) + Rule 4(m) (brief extension; deem-timely upon proofs).
4. Treat any NYSED/OP Professions mailings as courtesy (actual notice), not statutory service.
5. File an Affidavit of Service as soon as USPS flips to Delivered; supplement with PS-3811.

Copy-Paste (Reply § II.A)

USPS Certified (RRR) No. [ARTICLE NO.] mailed [DATE]; PS-3811 requested. USPS Express [EI####] — [Delivered/Scheduled] [DATE, TIME] (Ex. C). Rule 4(l)(3) permits proof to follow.

Operative Pleading (Rule 15(a)(1)): FAC filed [date], within 21 days of Rule 12(b) served [date] (15(a)(1)(B)); “leave” was courtesy. Futility is moot.

Less-drastic alternative: brief Rule 4(m) extension, deem-timely on proofs, then decide the PI (Rule 1).

Pitfalls

- Don’t rely on Stroe/DOH Legal for statutory service (courtesy only).
- Weekend deliveries can log “business closed”—not completion.

Outcome

Service off-ramp closed; judge can decide PI.

Sections & Drop-ins

- § II.A Service: RRR + Express lines; Rule 4(l)(3); Rule 4(m) deem-timely; Operative Pleading (Rule 15 timeline); Futility is moot; Less-drastic alternative (extend + decide).
- § I Younger (Bad-Faith): Diamond “D” at 199 + facts: post-speech pivot, misattribution after notice, compelled exam/releases.

# **JC-201 — Rule 15(a)(1) + Futility Moot 🧠**

Rule

One amendment as of right within 21 days of a Rule 12(b) motion → FAC operative upon filing.

Drop-in

Operative Pleading (Rule 15(a)(1)): FAC filed [date], within 21 days of Rule 12(b) served [date] (15(a)(1)(B)); “leave” was courtesy. Futility is moot; not a basis to deny or delay the PI; the FAC governs.

# **JC-202 — Younger Bad-Faith (Second Circuit) 🔒**

Rule (quote the standard)

Proceedings “animated by a retaliatory, harassing, or other illegitimate motive” trigger the exception. Diamond “D”, 282 F.3d at 199.

Fact map (check 2–3 minimum)

- Post-speech pivot to “mental-fitness.”
- Reliance on misattributed messages after notice (Ex. G–J).
- Compelled § 230(7) exam + blanket releases under threat to license.

# **JC-203 — Defer-then-Decide + Rule 52(a)(2) ⏱️**

Ask

If service proof is imminent, defer ruling until it’s filed; then decide on submission within 3 business days, with Rule 52(a)(2) written findings on each Winter factor.

Micro-Order (paste into proposed order)

1. Status-quo only (no exam/no blanket releases).
2. Rule 4(m) time extended; service deemed timely upon filing of Commissioner proof.
3. PI decided on submission within 3 business days after proofs.

# **JC-204 — “No Prejudice / Pro Se Solicitude” Pack ⚖️**

Reply block (right after § II.A service)

No prejudice. Defendants have actual notice, appeared, and briefed. A brief Rule 4(m) extension with deem-timely imposes no substantive burden and avoids duplicate filings (Rule 1).

Pro se solicitude. Courts construe pro se filings liberally and prefer decisions on the merits. Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520–21 (1972); Triestman, 470 F.3d 471, 474 (2d Cir. 2006); LeSane, 239 F.3d 206, 209 (2d Cir. 2001).
