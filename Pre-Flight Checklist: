Pre-Flight Checklist: The Final "Inspector" Pass
Before you move from Step 8 (Finalize) to Step 9 (File and Serve), run your document through this high-stakes checklist. This is designed to catch the "invisible" errors that often lead to motions to strike or summary rejections.

1. Procedural & Jurisdictional Integrity
- Caption Accuracy: Does the header match the exact formatting required by the local rules? (Case number, department/division, and party designations).
- Signature Block: Is the "S/" electronic signature or physical signature present as required by the specific court's e-filing rules?
- Certificate of Service: Is the "Proof of Service" attached to the end of the document, or is it ready to be filed as a separate standalone document?
1. Evidence & Linkage
- Exhibit ID Verification: Does every mention of an exhibit in the text (e.g., "See Exhibit A") match the actual label on the PDF attachment?
- The "Dead Link" Check: If you are filing electronically with hyperlinks, do they all resolve to the correct page in your evidence ledger?
- Authentication: Does the text briefly state the foundation for each piece of evidence? (e.g., "This email was sent from [Person] on [Date]").
1. The "Inspector" AI Logic Audit
- Negative Elements: Did the Inspector check for what is missing? (e.g., "You alleged a breach, but did you state the specific damages incurred?").
- Citation Formatting: Are the citations in the correct format for your jurisdiction (Bluebook vs. Local Style)?
- Word/Page Count: Does the document fall within the page limits set by the local or judge’s standing orders?
