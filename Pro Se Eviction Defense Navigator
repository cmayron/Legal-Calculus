Core data model (LC style)
	•	Claim = landlord theory (e.g., Nonpayment).
	•	Element[i] = what landlord must prove.
	•	Proof[i] = landlord evidence.
	•	Rebuttal[i] = your counter-proof.
	•	Defense = independent reason to deny/abate (retaliation, discrimination, notice defects, habitability).
	•	Procedure = rule with a deadline, form, service requirement.

Rules DSL (pluggable per state—example schema)

{
  "answer_deadline_days": 5,
  "service_slack_days": {"mail": 5, "personal": 0, "posting": 0, "email": 2},
  "notice_requirements": {
    "nonpayment": {"days": 5, "must_itemize": true},
    "no_cause": {"days": 30, "cooldown_after_complaint": true},
    "breach": {"cure_days": 10}
  },
  "filing": {"copies_required": 2, "fee_waiver_available": true}
}
Swap in the real numbers per jurisdiction without changing the workflow.

⸻

Procedural algorithms (plain-English + pseudo-logic)

A. Answer Clock
	•	DUE = service_date + answer_deadline_days + service_slack_days[method]
	•	If today > DUE → show Urgent: Ask for continuance + accept late filing if allowed.

B. Notice Validity
	•	If required notice days not met → Affirmative Defense: Defective Notice.
	•	If amount not itemized/fees illegal → Accounting Defense + Strike Fees.

C. Habitability / Repair
	•	If serious defects + landlord had notice + no timely repair → Abatement and optional Rent Escrow argument.
	•	Attach photos, dated complaints, inspections.

D. Retaliation
	•	If tenant exercised a right (complaint, organizing, inspection) within protected window → Retaliation Defense with burden shift if statute allows.

E. Discrimination / Accommodation
	•	If disability affects tenancy obligations and reasonable accommodation requested/denied → Fair Housing/ADA Defense + Motion for RA & Continuance.

F. Settlement Path
	•	Offer: payment plan, waiver of fees, repair order, mutual termination with dates, sealing/non-opposition to record relief.
