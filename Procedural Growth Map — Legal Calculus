# **🎯 What this is**

A concise roadmap from confusion → competence → coalition for pro se litigants using the Legal Calculus framework. Each stage includes goals, actions, artifacts, and subtle supports that make the process survivable.

# **🔎 Quick Summary**

- Fog → Orientation (Tier 1): Map facts, parties, deadlines, venue.
- Basics → First Filing (Tier 1 → 2): Draft, format, serve, prove.
- Competence → Preservation (Tier 2): Preserve issues early; attach proposed orders.
- Resistance → Resilience (Tier 2 → 4): Counter off-ramps; keep moving.
- Case-Ready → Appeal-Ready (Tier 4): Build the record you’ll need.
- Solo → Supported (Tier 5): Publish the archive; recruit allies.
- User → Builder (Tier 6–7): Automate and teach.
