## 🧭 System Map (LC • LCA • FG • FGA • JC • LCa)

- **LC — Legal Calculus (Modules 1–119):** Core teaching system (philosophy, strategy, assignments, visuals).
- **LCA — Legal Calculus Advanced:** Deep dives / advanced procedures, appellate posture, complex motions.
- **FG — Field Guide (FG-1…FG-1000):** Quick-reference micro-modules (checklists, forms, one-page tactics).
- **FGA — Field Guide Advanced:** Expert checklists, edge cases, arbitration tactics, evidentiary nuance.
- **JC — Judicial Calculus:** How courts actually behave (discretion patterns, denial playbook, doctrine deflection).
- **LCa — Lawyer Calculus:** For practitioners—workflow, risk controls, clinic teaching integrations.

> **Mental model:**  
> **FG/FGA = do it now.** • **LC/LCA = learn why + do it right.** • **JC/LCa = anticipate the system.**

## 🧰 Choose Your Mode

### 1) 🚨 Crisis Mode (Pro Se in a hurry)
1. Open **FG** index ➝ run the **task that matches your emergency** (e.g., *FG-47 TRO Steps*, *FG-210 Service Checklist*, *FG-800 Spotting Judicial Bias*).
2. Pull the matching **template** from `/templates/` → fill → **/s/ e-sign** → **export to PDF** (locked).
3. Add a **one-line Proposed Order** so the court has something to rule on.
4. Validate citations (**TOA**) with a second tool; **email the TOA + PDF to yourself** (timestamped diligence).
5. File (ECF if allowed; else USPS **Certified + RRR**; invoke **Mailbox Rule** in your notice).
6. If time allows, skim the paired **LC module(s)** (e.g., *Winter* standard, *Format is Force*) to strengthen the memo.
7. Archive in `/packets/` and reference the **docket number** in future filings.

**Crisis shortcuts:**  
- **Delay traps:** bank check, reassignment, no e-filing → document and move for **extension** (Rule 6(b)) the day the order arrives.  
- **Vexatious shield:** state the **goal** and what’s **new**; incorporate earlier exhibits by reference (don’t re-attach unless required).

### 2) 🧑‍🏫 Educator / Clinic Mode
1. Start from **Master Field Guide v1.0** (archive) for syllabus framing and case studies.  
2. Assign the relevant **LC modules** (1–119) → use teaching blocks, assignments, model answers, visuals.  
3. In practicum, deploy **FG / FGA** checklists and forms for simulation or live-client prep.  
4. Use **JC** to discuss judicial behavior (discretion vs. law, deflection patterns).  
5. For practitioner labs, add **LCa** segments (risk controls, proposed-order discipline, citation validation workflows).  
6. Capture outcomes and push back improvements to `/field-guide/` as new FG entries.

### 3) 🧪 Second-Opinion Mode (Litigant or Lawyer)
1. Run the **8-Step Second-Opinion Pass**:
   - (1) **State the goal** (preserve right? cure defect? get time?).  
   - (2) **Read the docket** (what exists / what’s missing).  
   - (3) Pull **FG micro-module(s)** for the task.  
   - (4) Open the paired **LC/LCA** modules to strengthen law & structure.  
   - (5) Validate cites → **TOA** → email yourself (proof of diligence).  
   - (6) Attach a **Proposed Order**.  
   - (7) **COS** (service) + filing plan (ECF/USPS + Mailbox Rule).  
   - (8) **Archive** to `/packets/` with date + purpose in filename.
2. Where arbitration intersects, consult **FGA + LCA** (e.g., AHLA rules, spoliation sanctions, punitive authority).
3. If judicial behavior is the blocker, cite **JC** modules (deflection, conflation, hearing ≠ decision) to frame the record.

## 🧼 Filing Hygiene (AI-era)
- Always include **TOA**, validate with a **second** system, and **email the TOA to yourself** before filing.  
- Export to **PDF** (locked) for the court; keep **.docx** editable.  
- Use **Proposed Orders** to avoid “nothing to rule” strikes.  
- Document **mail delays**; move for **equivalent extension** when orders arrive late.

## 💡 Why It Matters

**Filing is protest.**  
**Format is memory.**  
**The record is the remedy.**

Legal Calculus proves that structured legal argument — even when partially suppressed — **preserves procedural rights and appellate posture.**
