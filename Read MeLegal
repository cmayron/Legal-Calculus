Calculus Educational System (LCES) — Start Here

Modes: LC (why) • LCA (more) • FG (how) • FGA (advanced how) • JC (reality) • LCa (rep issues)

# Safety Rails:

 — Timing • Narrative • Relief • Procedure • Evidence • Service • Citations

# Workflow:

1) Collect Pillars → 2) Ask AI with the LCES prompt → 3) Build draft → 4) Run FG checklists → 5) Stress-test with JC → 6) If complex, consult LCA/FGA → 7) Finalize & file

# Disclaimer:

Educational toolkit. You’re responsible for your filings and deadlines.

# **The “Pillars of Knowledge” (what you feed to AI)**

Create a simple Notion template called “LCES Pillars” with these headings:

- Facts (chronology + who/what/where/when)
- Claims & Elements (cite the elements)
- Relief Sought (exact orders requested)
- Procedure/Posture (court, motions pending, deadlines)
- Evidence (exhibits, declarations, recordings)
- Service Plan (who/when/how)
- Citations (controlling authority first)
- Risks/Traps (abstention, jurisdiction, exhaustion, arbitration)

# **One master prompt to run in any AI**

Copy/paste this after the Pillars:

# LCES Concierge Prompt

Use LC (foundation) + FG (how) + JC (reality). If complexity appears, escalate to LCA/FGA.

Map my claims → elements → proof; flag missing facts.Build a procedural path (venue, motion, timing, service) with deadlines.Draft: caption, intro paragraph, facts in numbered paragraphs, claims by count, requested relief, proposed order, certificate of service.Run an FG checklist for formatting, exhibits, service, and rule cites.Do a JC stress test: likely off-ramps/gatekeeping and my counters.If needed, propose LCA/FGA advanced strategies (exceptions, parallel remedies, appellate posture).Output a filing-ready Word outline + a Notion checklist of “before file” tasks.

# **Minimal daily workflow (fast loop)**

1. Collect Pillars (10–20 min).
2. Run the Concierge Prompt with the Pillars.
3. Tighten with FG (add missing exhibits, service details).
4. Stress-test with JC (anticipate the judge’s off-ramp).
5. Escalate to LCA/FGA only if triggers appear (abstention, parallel forum, TRO timing, arbitration).
6. Ship (file) + Archive (your paper trail is your remedy).

# **LCa: working with or without a lawyer**

- Use LCa to write the scope memo (“what I want counsel to do / not do”), fee/withdrawal clauses, and expectations about format-first, record-first.
- Share your Pillars + Concierge output so counsel plugs into your structure instead of reinventing it.

# **Safety rails to never skip**

- Dates & clocks (compute deadlines out loud).
- Elements table (each claim has proof).
- Proposed order (make relief executable).
- Service specifics (who/when/how).
- Archive (mail receipts, tracking, ECF IDs—saved the same day).
