All set âœ…

Hereâ€™s your updated full site + kits bundle with a README included:
	â€¢	ðŸ“¦ Legal_Calculus_Full_Site_and_Kits_Bundle_with_README.zip

Inside youâ€™ll now find:
	â€¢	Everything from the site (index.html, Start Here, Master Index, kits, poster, builders, Makefile, etc.)
	â€¢	Plus a README.txt explaining exactly how to run build_all.sh, regenerate Start_Here.html & HASH_BADGES.md, and rebuild the QR poster with your hosting URL.

Do you want me to also add a sample deployment workflow (GitHub Actions YAML) so that every push auto-regenerates the site + poster and publishes to Pages?Â ï¿¼
