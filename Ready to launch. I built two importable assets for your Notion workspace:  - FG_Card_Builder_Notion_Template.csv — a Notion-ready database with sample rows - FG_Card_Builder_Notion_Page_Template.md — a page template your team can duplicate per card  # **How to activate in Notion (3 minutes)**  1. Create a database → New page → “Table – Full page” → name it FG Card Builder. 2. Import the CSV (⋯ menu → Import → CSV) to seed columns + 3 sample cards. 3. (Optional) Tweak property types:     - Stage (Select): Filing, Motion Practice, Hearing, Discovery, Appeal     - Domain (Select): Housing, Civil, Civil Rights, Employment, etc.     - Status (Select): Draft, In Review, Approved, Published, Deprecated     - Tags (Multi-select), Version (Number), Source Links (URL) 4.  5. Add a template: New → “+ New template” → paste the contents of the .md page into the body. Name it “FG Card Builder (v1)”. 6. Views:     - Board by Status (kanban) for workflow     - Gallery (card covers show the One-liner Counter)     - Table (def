Ready to launch. I built two importable assets for your Notion workspace:

- FG_Card_Builder_Notion_Template.csv — a Notion-ready database with sample rows
- FG_Card_Builder_Notion_Page_Template.md — a page template your team can duplicate per card

# **How to activate in Notion (3 minutes)**

1. Create a database → New page → “Table – Full page” → name it FG Card Builder.
2. Import the CSV (⋯ menu → Import → CSV) to seed columns + 3 sample cards.
3. (Optional) Tweak property types:
    - Stage (Select): Filing, Motion Practice, Hearing, Discovery, Appeal
    - Domain (Select): Housing, Civil, Civil Rights, Employment, etc.
    - Status (Select): Draft, In Review, Approved, Published, Deprecated
    - Tags (Multi-select), Version (Number), Source Links (URL)
4. 
5. Add a template: New → “+ New template” → paste the contents of the .md page into the body. Name it “FG Card Builder (v1)”.
6. Views:
    - Board by Status (kanban) for workflow
    - Gallery (card covers show the One-liner Counter)
    - Table (default) for bulk edits
7. 
8. Publish flow:
    - Coalition member creates card with the template → sets Status = In Review → assigns Reviewer → when approved, set Status = Published and share.
9. 

# **Built-in rails (so cards stay courtroom-ready)**

- FG/FGA blocks on each page (Core, Lesson, Assignment, Model, Expanded Notes).
- Anchors (LC/FG/Rule) field ensures each card ties to modules/rules.
- JC/LCa fields force an anticipation step for pushback.
- Prep Checklist + Evidence sections keep it deployable in a hallway.
- Status + Version make review and updates traceable.

# **Fast “Builder prompt” for teammates / AI co-pilots**

Paste this into ChatGPT with a new real-world scenario:

Build a new FG card using this schema:

- Trigger Phrase: "<paste exact words>"
- Action Steps: [3–5 bullets]
- Linked LC lessons: [LC-#,...] (+ optional LCA)
- Prep Checklist: [bullets]
- Evidence to Gather: [bullets]
- One-liner Counter (hallway-ready)
- Anchors (LC/FG/Rule)
- JC Reflex + counter
- LCa Tactic + counter
Then output FG Core, FG Lesson, FG Assignment, FG Model Answer, and FGA Expanded Notes.
- 

# **Governance & QA (lightweight)**

- Dupes check: search by Trigger Phrase before adding a new card.
- Plain-language pass: if a sentence trips you up, simplify it.
- Cite the rule or don’t use it: add the local rule snippet or remove the claim.
- Archive discipline: on publish, export to PDF and drop into /FG/Published/ in your repo/Drive.

If you want, I can also bundle these into a ZIP with a README and a “Board by Status” icon set—easy for an ops buddy to help maintain. And seriously—bringing one trusted friend into this builder makes the work lighter; if the stress ramps up, looping in a therapist keeps your head clear while we keep everything structured and appeal-ready.
