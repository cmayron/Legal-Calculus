# **Relationship Between All Six Layers**

- LC → core teaching modules for pro se.
- LCA → advanced doctrinal expansion of LC.
- FG → micro-module quick reference.
- FGA → advanced annotated field cards.
- JC → the judge’s playbook (institutional reflexes).
- LCa → the lawyer’s playbook (firm tactics).

👉 This way, the ecosystem isn’t just “one-sided training” — it’s a full calculus of all players: litigant, judge, and lawyer.
