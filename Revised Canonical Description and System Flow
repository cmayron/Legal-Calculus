This is a critical architectural distinction. The "Two- Blueprint" (GitHub + Notion) changes the map from a simple repository to a hybrid workflow where public code meets private strategy.
Here is the Revised Canonical Description and System Flow based on your correction.
I. The Revised LCES Architecture (Canonical Description)
Core Philosophy: "The Key is Open and Free."
The Legal Calculus Educational System (LCES) is an open-source framework that democratizes access to sophisticated legal engineering. It rejects the "paywall" of traditional justice, ensuring that the "Blueprint" for federal litigation is publicly accessible to anyone.
The "Dual-Source" Blueprint
The system does not rely on a single static document. The "Blueprint" is a living set of instructions derived from two synchronized sources:

- Public Source (The Standard): GitHub (cmayron/Legal-Calculus). Holds the immutable code, standardized modules (e.g., Mod 31, Mod 36), and the versioned "Calculus" logic. This is the "Open and Free" key available to the world.
- Private Source (The Lab): Notion (Charles Mayron MD Workspace). Holds the active case data, strategic architecture, and specific "Fact Generation" (FG) streams. This is where the standard code is adapted for specific litigation.
The AI Assembly Line
Once the user retrieves the Blueprint from these sources, the "Education" phase is complete. The user then activates the automated pipeline:
- Step 1: Builder AI: Ingests the Blueprint (GitHub modules) and Case Facts (Notion). It acts as the construction crew, assembling the raw arguments into a structured legal draft (e.g., a Motion or Complaint).
- Step 2: Inspector AI: Ingests the draft from the Builder. It acts as the compliance officer, rigorously stress-testing the document against Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP), logic gates, and the original "Calculus" to ensure zero defects before filing.
II. Visualizing the "Mayron Pipeline"
1. INPUT: The "Blueprint" (Dual Source)
- Source A (GitHub): [Standard Modules] + [Logic Rules] + [Templates]
- Source B (Notion): [Case Facts] + [Strategy Notes] + [Evidence]
    - Action: User synthesizes these into the "Instruction Set."
1. PROCESS: The AI Engine
- Phase A: Builder AI
    - Input: Instruction Set.
    - Function: Drafting & Assembly.
    - Output: "Draft Candidate 1.0"
- Phase B: Inspector AI
    - Input: Draft Candidate 1.0.
    - Function: adversarial Review, Rule Checking (FRCP), Logic Verification.
    - Output: "Court-Ready Filing" (Federal Filing Bundle)
    III. Updated Timeline Significance
    This clarification updates the August 6, 2025, timeline entry.
- August 6, 2025: The "Federal Filing Bundle" ZIP on GitHub isn't just a document; it is the Output Product of this specific pipeline. It proves that the Builder AI and Inspector AI successfully processed the GitHub/Notion blueprint into a file accepted by the NDNY Federal Court.
Next Step for the Report
I have the GitHub side (Source A). To make the "Link Map" complete:
Would you like me to create a "Template Page" for your Notion workspace that structures the data exactly how the Builder AI needs to receive it?
(This would ensure that anyone who forks your GitHub repo knows exactly how to set up their private Notion to match your workflow.)
