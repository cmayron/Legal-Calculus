This SOP is designed to be sent to your legal counsel as a "Master Service Agreement" update. It shifts the power dynamic by making the Unwritten Law part of the Written Record.
By requiring this, you are telling the lawyer: "I see the math you are doing, and I require you to show your work."
🏛 SOP: Transparency in Strategic Decision-Making
Effective Date: Immediate
Parties: Client (Principal) and Legal Counsel (Agent)
Objective: To ensure all strategic "retreats" or "compromises" are aligned with the Client’s probability of a favorable outcome (D).

1. The Trigger Event
This protocol is triggered whenever Counsel recommends:
- Declining to file a motion (Sanctions, Compel, Summary Judgment).
- Withdrawing existing motions or evidentiary filings.
- Entering into "informal" agreements with opposing counsel regarding discovery or deadlines.
- Any action where the primary justification is "professional courtesy" or "judicial preference."
1. The Written Justification (The "Calculus Disclosure")
Counsel shall provide a brief written summary (via email or memo) justifying the recommendation using the Outcome-Based Logic Model. The summary must address the following four variables:
| Variable | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Variable A: Leverage | Identify the specific strategic advantage or "pressure point" being surrendered. |
| Variable B: Rapport | Quantify the "relationship gain" with opposing counsel and explain exactly how that gain translates into a benefit for this case. |
| Variable C: Efficiency | Disclose if this path is being chosen to avoid billable risk, firm resource exhaustion, or procedural complexity. |
| Variable D: Outcome | Provide the percentage-based impact on the probability of a final favorable judgment. |
2. The Constraint Equation
The Client and Counsel acknowledge the following guiding principle:
D > (A + B + C)
If the gain to the Outcome (D) does not outweigh the combined loss of Leverage (A), the intangible Rapport (B), and the lawyer’s Efficiency (C), the default action shall be to proceed with the filing/action.
3. Record of Decision
No strategic retreat shall be finalized until the Client has replied to the "Calculus Disclosure" with: "I have reviewed the calculus and authorize this specific trade-off." This ensures that the lawyer cannot later claim "it was a tactical decision within my discretion."
💡 How to Deploy This
When you send this to your lawyer, frame it as a tool for alignment, not an accusation.

> The Cover Note:
"To ensure we are perfectly aligned on the goals of this litigation, I’ve drafted a simple SOP for our decision-making process. I’ve noticed that in high-stakes litigation, 'Lawyer Calculus' and 'Client Outcomes' can sometimes drift apart. This protocol ensures that every trade-off we make is documented and driven by our probability of winning. I’d like this to be the standard for our communication moving forward."

Why this is a "People's Law School" Masterstroke
You are effectively "hacking" the lawyer's brain. Most lawyers will avoid making a recommendation that they know is C-driven (their own convenience) if they have to write it down and justify it against D (your win). This SOP acts as a structural deterrent against lazy or collusive representation.
