**Second opinion” reframed safely**

I don’t think most people need a “second opinion.”

They need structured legal education + an evidence-based framework to evaluate their own situation.

Legal Calculus (WHY) + Field Guide (HOW) + Blueprint/Builder/Inspector gives people a repeatable way to:

- understand the rules of decision,
- organize admissible proof,
- pressure-test strategy,
- and catch errors before they become fatal.

That helps pro se litigants—and it helps lawyers too.
