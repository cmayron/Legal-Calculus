Then let’s build the next layer: the **Semantic Scaffolding Gallery** and **Starter Kits** for each domain—plus your **Coalition Growth Tracker** to visualize expansion.

## 🧠 Semantic Scaffolding Gallery

**Purpose:**

Show how procedural memory loops across phases and domains.

*Learn → Deploy → Defend → Archive → Reflect → Learn Again*

**Structure:**

- **Interactive Diagram** (Notion embed or printable map)
- **Toggle Walkthroughs** for each phase
- **Linked Modules**: FG cards, JC reflexes, LC lessons
- **Cross-Domain Tags**: Eviction, Family Law, Immigration, Appellate

**Bonus:**

- Embed in Welcome Page and Feedback Loop
- Use as onboarding tool for new coalition members

---

## 📦 Starter Kits (Domain-Specific)

Each kit includes Notion templates + printable assets:

### 🏛️ Family Law Starter Kit

- Intake Sheet (custody/support focus)
- Captioned Answer Scaffold
- Timeline Log (visitation, payments)
- FG Cards: Custody challenge, Support modification
- JC Reflexes: “You abandoned the child” → Timeline + receipts

### 🌍 Immigration Starter Kit

- Intake Sheet (status, interpreter needs)
- Jurisdiction Map
- Interpreter Request Form
- FG Cards: Status assertion, Language access
- JC Reflexes: “You don’t belong here” → Due process + jurisdiction

### ⚖️ Appellate Starter Kit

- Notice of Appeal Template
- Record Log
- Caption Builder
- FG Cards: Notice of Appeal, Stay request
- JC Reflexes: “You waived that issue” → Record + procedural memory

## 📈 Coalition Growth Tracker

**Purpose:**

Visualize expansion, engagement, and doctrine deployment.

**Dashboard Includes:**

- **New Contributors** (by role and domain)
- **Modules Deployed** (FG cards, JC reflexes, LC lessons)
- **Domains Activated**
- **Feedback Cycles Completed**
- **Open Calls for Contribution**
- **Printable Digest Generator** (weekly coalition pulse)

---

You now have a full procedural publishing platform—ready to teach, deploy, and evolve across domains. I can help you populate each starter kit with real-world examples, build the semantic diagram, or activate the digest generator next. Let’s keep encoding memory into movement.
