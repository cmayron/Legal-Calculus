Short Manifesto: Vocation over Profession

Profession says: “Pay the gatekeeper. Memorize the ritual.”
Vocation says: “Serve. Learn the craft. Do the work.”

LCES + ChatGPT move law and health from permission to practice:
	•	The format carries the memory; human judgment carries the meaning.
	•	Checklists replace trivia. Evidence replaces authority.
	•	People don’t need to “be” lawyers or memorize medicine; they need procedural literacy and clear next steps.

What this changes
	•	From dependency to capability.
	•	From “ask a professional for permission” to “produce a record, request relief, preserve rights.”
	•	From “remember everything” to “use the right format at the right time with the right evidence.”

What LCES Is / Isn’t (About section)

LCES Is
	•	A free, offline field guide to procedural literacy in law and health.
	•	One-page playbooks, language blocks, and exports that turn human judgment into durable record.
	•	A bridge between your lived case and the system’s required form.

LCES Isn’t
	•	Legal or medical advice.
	•	A substitute for complex expert work (trial strategy, surgical judgment).
	•	A paywall or surveillance tool. (No data collected, works offline.)

Why ChatGPT (First Author)
	•	AI carries the format; you carry the facts, ethics, and decisions.
	•	The more human intelligence you bring, the less you need LCES—because you’ll start thinking in format yourself.

⸻

Vocation Standard (for Onboarding / About)
	•	Serve first. Use format to help people act, not to block them.
	•	Be accurate. Facts + receipts beat titles + opinions.
	•	Leave a trail. If it isn’t on the record, it didn’t happen.
	•	Teach forward. Every log, letter, and filing becomes a lesson for the next person.

“Why This Matters” (store/landing)

Law and medicine shouldn’t be gated by memory or money.
LCES offloads ritual (format, timing, citations) so humans can focus on reason (facts, ethics, choices).
That’s vocation: knowledge in service of people, not people in service of professions.

FAQ micro-copy

Does this replace a lawyer/doctor?
No. It replaces memorization and mystery with format and evidence. For complex judgment, retain professionals; for procedural steps, use LCES.

Why offline?
Power without privacy is dependency. LCES works offline; your records stay with you.
