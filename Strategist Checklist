## Template: Neutral Request — AI Use Clarification

**File as:** Notice of Request for Clarification Regarding [Order Title]

**To:** The Honorable [Judge Name], [Court Name]

**Re:** [Case Caption, Case No.]

Your Honor,

Pursuant to [local rule re: clerical corrections or inquiries], [Party Name] respectfully requests clarification regarding the [Date] Order on [Subject]. Recent public reports indicate that some courts have inadvertently relied on generative AI tools that introduced citation or quotation errors.

To ensure an accurate record, [Party Name] asks whether generative AI was used in drafting the Order and, if so, whether the citations and quotations were independently verified against official sources.

No argument on the merits is intended. [Party Name] seeks only to confirm the factual basis of the record.

Respectfully submitted,

[Signature block]

## Template: Correction Request Cover (Clerical or Nonsubstantive)

**To:** The Honorable [Judge Name], [Court Name]

**Re:** [Case Caption, Case No.]

Your Honor,

Pursuant to [Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(a) / local rule reference], [Party Name] respectfully requests correction of apparent clerical errors in the [Date] Order on [Subject]. The attached Quote Accuracy Appendix compares quotations in the Order with the official source documents.

[Party Name] does not seek reconsideration or argue the merits. This request addresses only factual accuracy of citations and quotations to preserve a clean record.

Respectfully submitted,

[Signature block]

**Attachments:** Quote Accuracy Appendix; [source documents]

## Template: Quote Accuracy Appendix

**Attachment A:** Quote Accuracy Appendix to [Order Title]

**Case:** [Case Caption, Case No.]

## Methodology Note: AI Guardrails Through Dual-Layer Verification

When one AI system (the "builder") generates citations or legal content, a second AI system (the "inspector" or "stress test" AI) can verify the output against source documents. This dual-layer approach creates guardrails by having independent systems check each other's work, reducing the risk of propagating errors into the legal record.

[Date]

## Why Independent AI Inspection is Essential

The primary reason not to assume the builder AI can be trusted is that **AI systems can confidently generate plausible-looking but factually incorrect content** — a phenomenon known as "hallucination." Without independent verification, these errors can propagate into legal documents, court filings, and official records.

**Key risks of unchecked builder AI output:**

- **Citation fabrication:** AI may generate case names, reporters, or pin-cites that do not exist or misattribute holdings to the wrong cases.
- **Quote distortion:** AI may paraphrase or alter quotations while presenting them as direct quotes, changing legal meaning.
- **Context collapse:** AI may strip context from a source, making a quote appear to support a proposition it does not.
- **Outdated or superseded law:** AI training data may not reflect recent precedent, overrulings, or statutory amendments.

An independent inspector AI — operating with different architecture, training data, or verification protocols — serves as a **cross-check** by:

- Retrieving and comparing original source documents
- Flagging discrepancies between generated text and verified sources
- Confirming that citations resolve to real, relevant authority
- Providing a second layer of accountability before content enters the legal record

This dual-layer model mirrors traditional legal practice: one attorney drafts, another reviews. It embeds a structural safeguard against the propagation of AI-generated errors into authoritative legal proceedings.
