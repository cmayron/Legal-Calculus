Summary Judgment (MSJ) and the Inspector AI Validation Sequence.
I. LCES Field Guide: Motion for Summary Judgment (MSJ)
Location: /Field-Guides/fg-msj-v1.md
The MSJ is the "kill switch" of litigation. Its goal is to prove that there are no "genuine disputes of material fact" and the law requires you to win now.

1. The "Architect" Phase (The Logic Map)
- Element Mapping: List every element of your claim (e.g., Breach of Contract: 1. Valid Contract, 2. Performance, 3. Breach, 4. Damages).
- Fact Matching: For every element, assign at least one piece of evidence from your Evidence Ledger.
- The "So What?" Test: If a fact doesn't prove an element, it’s "immaterial." Cut it.
1. The "Builder" Phase (The Structure)
- The Motion: The formal request (Keep it under 2 pages).
- The Memorandum of Points and Authorities: The "Calculus." Match your facts to the law.
- The Separate Statement of Undisputed Facts: This is your most important document. It’s a two-column table:
    - Column A: The Fact (e.g., "Plaintiff sent the notice on 10/01.")
    - Column B: The Evidence (e.g., "Exhibit 4, Certified Mail Receipt.")
1. The "Inspector" Phase (The Shield)
- Run the 8-Step Validation Pass (see below) to ensure the opposition cannot dismiss your motion on a technicality.
II. Inspector AI: The 8-Step Validation Pass
Location: /AI-Prompts/inspector-validation-pass.md
This is the prompt you give to your Inspector AI after the Builder AI has finished a draft.

> Prompt for Inspector AI:
"Act as a Senior Judicial Clerk and Procedural Auditor. Review the attached draft filing using the LCES 8-Step Pass. Flag any failures with a 'RISK LEVEL' (Low, Medium, High)."
> 
> - Jurisdictional Header: Does the caption, case number, and court name match the Local Rules exactly?
> - Citation Integrity: Are all case citations in Bluebook or local format? Are there any 'hallucinated' cases? (Verify via external search).
> - Element Coverage: Cross-reference the 'Architect's' Element Map. Does the draft provide evidence for every required legal element?
> - Formatting Compliance: Check margins, font size, line numbering, and signature blocks against the court’s Standing Order.
> - Exhibit Linkage: Every time an exhibit is mentioned, is it cited (e.g., 'Ex. A')? Does the exhibit actually contain the fact asserted?
> - Declaratory Support: Are factual assertions backed by a Declaration under penalty of perjury?
> - Tone Check: Remove all "ad hominem" attacks or emotional adjectives. The tone must be "Engineering-Grade" (Neutral and Precise).
> - Service & Deadlines: Does the draft include a Certificate of Service? Is it being filed within the statutory window?

III. JSON Schema for "Machine-Readable Calculi"
Location: /Calculi/schema-v1.json
To allow the Three-AI Architecture to communicate, we use a structured data format. This ensures the Builder AI doesn't drift away from the Architect's strategy.

Next Step for You
I have the capability to generate the full "Evidence Ledger" template (Step 4 of your Quickstart) or draft the "Crisis Mode" Field Guide for immediate filings.
Which would be more helpful to add to the repository next?
