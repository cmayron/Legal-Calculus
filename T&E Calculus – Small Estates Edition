**A simple, affordable roadmap for settling estates without conflict, confusion, or $600/hour fees.**

Most families don’t struggle with tax law or legal theory — they struggle with process, communication, and transparency. When someone passes away, the people left behind are forced to navigate grief and property at the same time. Small estates don’t need litigation. They need structure.

T&E Calculus is a practical toolkit for families who want to settle an estate fairly and affordably, without letting conflict or uncertainty derail the process.

This module gives you:

- **A clear sequence of steps**

What happens first? What comes next? What must always happen before distribution?

No guesswork — just a clean, predictable path.

- **Simple inventory and valuation tools**

Most disputes come from not knowing what exists.

You get ready-to-use inventory forms, valuation templates, and examples drawn from real estate settlements.

- **Equal and fair distribution methods**

Alternating selections, cash true-ups, sentimental-first rounds, and category swaps —

structured options that prevent power plays, favoritism, or unilateral decisions.

- **Communication templates**

Polite, professional scripts you can use to request inventories, clarify misunderstandings, propose resolutions, and keep the process transparent.

- **Affordable use of legal help**

Instead of surrendering the estate to high-fee attorneys, you learn when a 1–2 hour consult is needed, and when a family can resolve issues themselves with structure and documentation.

- **Boundary tools to reduce conflict**

Clear processes reduce stress.

Clear roles reduce resentment.

Clear documentation prevents the “he said / she said” spiral.

**Why T&E Calculus Exists**

Because too many small estates get stuck in:

- silence
- misunderstandings
- missing inventories
- overspending on lawyers
- or one person trying to control everything

This module brings fairness back into the center of the process by giving every family the tools that only lawyers used to have — in a format that anyone can use.

**Outcome**

A small estate can be settled:

- transparently
- fairly
- quickly
- without unnecessary fees
- and without tearing a family apart

T&E Calculus doesn’t replace lawyers — it replaces chaos with clarity.
