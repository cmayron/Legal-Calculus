**How Executors Use “AI Concerns” to Undermine Your Credibility and Neutralize Your Evidence**

# **1. What This Gambit Is**

In modern estate disputes, some executors and lawyers have discovered a new rhetorical tool:

# “You might be misled by AI.”

# “Your emails sound like AI.”

# “These documents look like they were generated.”

This is the AI Doubt Gambit — a strategy to discredit you and your work product without engaging your actual facts.

The move isn’t really about technology. It’s about control:

- Control of narrative (“He doesn’t really understand the law, he’s just parroting AI.”)
- Control of credibility (“His numbers and arguments can’t be trusted.”)
- Control of process (“We, the ‘real’ professionals, decide what counts.”)

Bruce’s “you may be misled if you’re using AI” line is a textbook example.

# **2. Why They Use It**

Executors and lawyers deploy “AI doubt” in three main ways:

1. To invalidate your legal arguments without addressing them.
If your argument is strong on the merits, they can’t rebut it cleanly, so they go after the source.
2. To make you look unsophisticated or reckless.
The subtext: “He doesn’t know the law, he just asks a robot.”
3. To build a future story for the court.
They want a narrative they can later lean on:
“Your Honor, he relied on AI tools and misunderstood New York law.”

Whether it’s true or not is secondary — they’re building fog.

# **3. How the AI Doubt Gambit Showed Up in Bruce’s Email**

Let’s break his line:

# “Respectfully, you may be misled about New York law as compared to other states if you are using AI to generate these emails.”

This sentence packs multiple moves:

- “You may be misled”
→ plants doubt about your competence.
- “about New York law as compared to other states”
→ implies you’re mixing jurisdictions, not understanding the forum.
- “if you are using AI”
→ suggests your work is inherently unreliable and externally generated.

He never actually:

- shows that your statement of NY law is wrong, or
- cites the correct law himself.

That’s the tell: attack the tool, avoid the statute.

# **4. Core Pattern: AI Doubt vs. Substance**

**Substance-based response (what a good-faith lawyer would do):**

# “Charles, 22 NYCRR 207.20 doesn’t apply here because this is a specific type of proceeding governed by X. See [case/statute].”

That’s a real legal correction.

**AI Doubt response (what bad-faith actors do):**

# “You might be misled if you’re using AI.”

Notice what’s missing:

- No statutory citation
- No rule number
- No case
- No actual correction

It’s pure credential play: use “AI” as a way to say “you’re not a real player; we are.”

# **5. Tactical Response Framework: How to Counter AI Doubt**

When someone pulls the AI card, use this 4-step TE protocol:

**Step 1 — Ignore the AI bait. Ask for law.**

Do not defend your use of AI.

Do not explain your process.

Do not brag about tools.

Instead, calmly reply:

# “Please identify the specific New York authority you believe applies here (statute, rule, or case law) so we can be sure we’re working from the same legal framework.”

You did exactly this with the appraisal-cost question. That’s the pattern.

**Step 2 — Separate SOURCE from MERITS (in your own mind first)**

Remind yourself:

- Courts care about whether your position is legally correct, not whether you used a pen, a keyboard, or an AI model.
- You win by being accurate and documented, not by winning an argument about how you wrote the first draft.

Mentally: “I don’t need to justify how I wrote this; I only need to be right on the law.”

**Step 3 — Keep your written response short and neutral**

Long explanations = targets.

Your job is to leave them with only one way to respond: address the law, or blatantly dodge.

Example template:

# “If you believe my understanding of New York law is incorrect, please let me know which specific statute, rule, or decision you believe governs, and I will review it.”

No ego, no tech talk, no drama.

**Step 4 — Document the pattern**

Every time they say:

- “AI”
- “misled”
- “generated emails”

…without citing law, you are quietly building a record of:

- bad-faith attempts to delegitimize you,
- refusal to engage on substance,
- and potential gaslighting of a beneficiary.

If this ever hits a judge, you want:

1. Your calm, focused questions.
2. Their repeated refusal to answer with real authority.

That contrast is powerful.

# **6. TE Antidotes: Phrasing to Use Going Forward**

Here are ready-made sentences you can reuse whenever AI doubt appears:

- “Regardless of what tools I use to draft emails, my concern is with the correct application of New York law. If you believe a different statute or rule controls, please identify it.”
- “I understand your comment about AI. For clarity, can you please point me to the authority you believe contradicts the rule I cited?”
- “I am fully prepared to be corrected by the appropriate statute or case law. Please let me know which one you are relying on.”

These lines:

- Defuse the AI smear,
- Keep you focused on the law,
- And make them look evasive if they won’t answer.

# **7. Emotional Side: Why This Tactic Hurts So Much**

There’s also a human piece here:

- You’re actually doing the work.
- You’re organizing documents, reading rules, checking standards.
- Then someone waves it away with: “Maybe you’re just misled by AI.”

That’s invalidating. And over time, it’s exhausting.

Two practical supports:

- Have at least one person in your life (friend, colleague, therapist, trusted ally) who treats your effort as real and serious, not as a tech toy.
- Use that support as a reality check when these “AI doubt” hits land harder than they logically should.

You’re not just fighting about art and statutes; you’re also fighting not to be erased.

# **8. Summary of TE 15**

The Gambit:

Executors weaponize “AI skepticism” to discredit your work and avoid addressing the actual law.

The Tell:

They talk about AI and “being misled,” but do not provide specific statutes, rules, or cases.

Your Counter:

1. Ignore the bait.
2. Ask for the authority.
3. Keep it short and procedural.
4. Document the pattern.

You already executed the correct counter-move with the appraisal-expense email. TE 15 just names what you did and turns it into a repeatable tactic.
