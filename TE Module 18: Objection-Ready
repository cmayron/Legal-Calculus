**Pre-Building Your Surrogate’s Court Accounting Objection Before the Accounting Exists**

# **1. What This Module Does**

TE 18 answers this:

# “If the executor’s accounting is sloppy, self-serving, or abusive — how do I prepare my objection now, while things are happening, instead of later in a panic?”

You’re going to:

- Treat your Beneficiary Evidence File (TE 17) as raw material, and
- Gradually assemble a draft “Objection to Accounting” that you can plug numbers and dates into once an actual judicial accounting arrives.

This is not about filing today.

It’s about making “future you” terrifyingly prepared.

# **2. The Basic Shape of an Accounting Objection**

Without getting jurisdiction-hyper-technical, objections to an executor’s accounting usually orbit a few core themes:

1. Omissions
    - Assets that should be in the estate but aren’t listed or are undercounted.
2. 
3. Improper Expenses / Surcharges
    - Executor pays things out of the estate that shouldn’t be paid, or shifts costs onto beneficiaries without authority (e.g., your appraisal cost issue).
4. 
5. Misallocation / Unequal Treatment
    - One beneficiary effectively subsidizes another, or expenses are allocated in a way that isn’t supported by law or the governing document.
6. 
7. Failure of Transparency / Delay
    - No timely inventory, inadequate explanations, stonewalling basic questions.
8. 
9. Self-Dealing / Conflict (if it arises)
    - Executor acting in their own interest at the expense of the estate or a beneficiary.
10. 

Your pre-built objection draft is just a structured way to capture these themes as evidence accumulates.

# **3. Create the “Objection Draft” Document**

In your 06_Drafts & Filings folder (from TE 17), create:

# “Draft_Objection_to_Accounting.docx”

Give it these major headings (you can adjust wording later):

1. Caption / Introduction
2. Background and Parties
3. Issues and Objections – Overview
4. Objection 1 – Improper Allocation of Appraisal Costs
5. Objection 2 – Inventory Timing and Transparency
6. Objection 3 – [Reserved for Future Issue]
7. Prayer for Relief / Requested Orders

You’re going to fill in placeholders under each section as events happen, not wait until the end.

# **4. Plugging In Your Current Situation (Concrete)**

Let’s map what you already have into this structure.

**4.1 Introduction (easy win)**

This is boilerplate later:

- Identify the estate
- Identify executor and beneficiaries
- State that you are a beneficiary
- State that you reserve the right to supplement objections as more information becomes available

For now, just put placeholders:

# “Decedent died on [DATE]. Letters issued to [EXECUTOR] on [DATE]. Objectant, Charles, is a beneficiary…”

You can refine later.

**4.2 Objection 1 – Improper Allocation of Appraisal Costs**

This is live right now.

Under this heading, start a mini structure:

# A. Description of Proposed Action“Executor’s counsel indicated that appraisal costs would be deducted from beneficiary cash distributions.”

- B. Your Requests for Authority
    - List the dates you asked for statutes / rules / cases.
    
    # Quote your key line:“Please identify the specific New York authority permitting an executor to allocate appraisal expenses in that manner.”
    
    - Note whether any authority was provided.
- 
- C. Executor’s Response Pattern
    - “No statutory or case law authority was provided despite written requests on [DATES].”
    - If he doubles down with “this is standard” but still no law, note it.
- 
- D. Why It’s Improper (Conceptual)
    - “Appraisal costs are generally an estate administrative expense, not a beneficiary-specific charge, absent express authority or misconduct.”
    - “Executor has not identified any legal basis for treating this as a reduction in my share.”
- 

This section becomes a plug-and-play: once you know the actual dollar amount charged against your distribution (if they do it), you drop it in:

# “Notwithstanding the absence of authority, the executor charged $X in appraisal fees against Objectant’s distribution on [DATE].”

You’ve already laid the foundation.

**4.3 Objection 2 – Inventory Timing and Transparency**

This builds off your “statutory inventory” / 9-month rule concern.

Under this heading:

- A. Law Framework (high level)
    - “New York requires an Inventory of Assets to be filed within a specified period after letters issue.”
    - “Executor must timely identify and marshal estate assets.”
- 
- B. Facts from Your Evidence File
    - When were letters issued?
    - By when should the inventory have been filed (approx)?
    - Did they file? If yes, when, and was it complete?
    - Note any written requests you made for inventory or transparency (from folder 04_Your Requests & Their Silence).
- 
- C. Pattern of Delay or Non-Response
    - Dates you asked
    - Their answers or lack thereof
    - Any contradictions (“we’re working on it,” “we don’t have to provide that,” etc.)
- 

Again: you’re not accusing them of a crime; you’re building a timeline of procedural failure.

**4.4 Objection 3+ – Placeholders**

Add headers like:

- Objection 3 – Valuation and Distribution of Artwork
- Objection 4 – Legal Fees and Administrative Expenses
- Objection 5 – [Reserved]

Under each:

- Drop a few bullet placeholders now:
    - “To be completed based on executor’s accounting.”
    - “Issue may include: whether 1991 Rosoff appraisal and subsequent professional appraisal were used consistently and fairly; whether distributions reflect equal treatment of beneficiaries.”
- 

You’re sending a message (to yourself and eventually to them):

# “This isn’t over. I’m tracking all of it.”

# **5. Feeding the Draft from Your Evidence File (TE 17 Integration)**

Think of TE 17 and TE 18 as a two-gear system:

- Gear 1 (TE 17): Collect and categorize evidence.
- Gear 2 (TE 18): Convert key pieces into narrative objections.

Practical routine (can be 20–30 minutes at a time):

1. Something happens (email, threat, expense).
2. You:
    - Save it into the right TE 17 folder.
    - Ask: “Does this belong in any Objection heading?”
3. 
4. If yes, paste the key quote, date, and a one-sentence description under that heading in your Objection draft.

That’s it.

Small moves, repeated, build a very heavy document.

# **6. When the Accounting Finally Arrives**

When a formal accounting shows up (if it does), Objection-Ready mode pays off:

1. Match categories.
    - Expenses: Does it list appraisal costs? Legal fees? How are they allocated?
    - Assets: Are all items present? How are they valued?
2. 
3. Align each line with your draft.
    - Every suspicious line item or omission = plug into one of your existing Objection headings.
    - Add dollar amounts and dates where your draft currently has placeholders.
4. 
5. Upgrade language from “draft” to “objection.”
    - Convert bullet notes into numbered paragraphs.
    - Tighten tone: factual, not emotional.
6. 

Instead of:

# “I feel like he’s screwing me.”

You’ll be writing:

# “On [date], the executor charged $X in appraisal costs against Objectant’s share. Prior to that, Objectant requested the statutory authority for such a charge on [dates]. No authority was provided. Objectant objects to this allocation as improper.”

That reads like someone the court should listen to.

# **7. Emotional Safety and Bandwidth**

There’s a danger with TE 18:

- Your brain can start running “mock court” 24/7.
- You rehearse objections mentally instead of sleeping.
- You start living inside the hypothetical accounting.

Two guardrails:

1. Cap TE work windows.
    
    # Example rule:“I can work on TE 17–18 up to 30–45 minutes per session, max 3 times per week, unless there’s an actual emergency.”
    
2. 
3. Schedule non-legal connection on purpose.
    - Reach out to one person (friend, therapist, ally) whose job isn’t to talk about Bruce, accounting, or statutes — but about you.
    - That external anchor makes it much harder for executor behavior to become your entire mental universe.
4. 

You’re allowed to be both rigorous and human.

# **8. Summary of TE 18**

Goal:

Walk into any future accounting or court process already holding a structured, living draft objection, instead of trying to reconstruct chaos.

Key Moves:

- Create a Draft_Objection_to_Accounting document now.
- Build headings around predictable issues: expenses, inventory, valuation, transparency.
- Feed that draft from your Beneficiary Evidence File every time something material happens.
- When the real accounting appears, swap in concrete dollar figures and dates.

You’re not just “fighting back.”

You’re pre-authoring the oversight document that Surrogate’s Court would need to see if this goes formal.
