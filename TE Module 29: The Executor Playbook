**Predicting Their Next 5 Moves Before They Make Them**

Executors who are cornered — especially siblings acting through lawyers — almost always follow the same psychological and procedural sequence.

You’ve already disrupted their first two major plays (DD-only accounting + “crazy-maker”), so now the next stage begins.

Below are the 5 moves they will likely make next, why they make them, how to recognize each, and the exact TE counter.

# **Move 1: The “Delay & Drift” Strategy**

**What they’ll do:**

Now that you’ve sent:

- the jewelry list,
- the authority request,
- and anchored the art to the 1991 appraisal,

they will slow things down.

Expect:

- No reply
- “We’re working on it”
- “We’ll get to that soon”
- “There’s no rush”
- “After the holiday…”
- “Once we gather everything…”

**Why they do it:**

They need time to:

- reconstruct a narrative,
- decide which jewelry story to stick to,
- avoid confirming anything in writing,
- wait for your emotional fatigue,
- hope you “cool off” and drop pressure.

**How you counter:**

Use TE 16 (Silence → Evidence).

Send ONE follow-up:

# “I didn’t see a response to the question about authority / inventory. I’m asking so the record is clear.”

Then stop.

Their delay becomes your proof of breach of duty.

# **Move 2: The “Sentimental Smokescreen”**

(You already saw this coming — TE 27)

**What they’ll do:**

Shift from facts → feelings.

- “Mom wouldn’t want us fighting.”
- “These pieces aren’t about value.”
- “This is sentimental, not financial.”
- “Let’s just divide things peacefully.”

**Why they do it:**

Emotional framing:

- makes you look “cold” for asking for inventory
- dilutes your legal clarity
- distracts from missing items
- resets the conversation away from accountability

**How you counter:**

Use the Dual-Track Response:

# “I value Mom’s memory too.

# At the same time, we still need a complete list of what existed at the time of death.”

You disarm emotion but stay anchored to procedure.

# **Move 3: The “Reverse Blame” Pivot**

**What they’ll do:**

Attack your credibility.

- “He’s being difficult.”
- “He’s misunderstanding things.”
- “He’s overreacting.”
- “He’s creating drama.”
- “He’s using AI and getting confused.”

Bruce already attempted this.

**Why they do it:**

If you look unreasonable, then THEY don’t have to:

- provide inventory,
- answer questions,
- cite law,
- admit missing items,
- justify DD-only accounting.

The crazier you seem, the safer they are.

**How you counter:**

Keep all your messages:

- short
- procedural
- neutral
- anchored to law and inventory

Every emotional attack becomes a bad look for them, not you.

# **Move 4: The “Half-Accounting” Move**

**What they’ll do:**

Provide something like:

- a partial DD list,
- a sentimental summary,
- a vague “inventory,”
- a “working list,”
- or incomplete itemization.

Designed to look like compliance but omits key items.

Specifically:

- Jewelry that Michele already took
- Items in prior photos but not on new list
- Items that “went missing”
- “Costume” jewelry that suddenly disappeared
- True high-value pieces not mentioned

**Why they do it:**

This is how executors “launder” missing items into the fog.

**How you counter:**

Compare their list to:

- your apartment list,
- any old photos,
- insurance docs,
- known items at death.

Where items are missing, ask:

# “Can you confirm the status of item J5 / J7 / etc?”

Again — no accusation.

Just status requests.

If they can’t explain?

That becomes court-grade breach material.

# **Move 5: The “Premature Distribution Push”**

**What they’ll do:**

Once they produce a partial list and sentimental framing, they’ll push:

- “Let’s just choose what we want now.”
- “Let’s divide things and move on.”
- “This is taking too long — let’s wrap up.”

**Why they do it:**

They want to lock in the fog before you ask more questions.

If you accept division prematurely:

- Missing items become unprovable.
- Their possession becomes normalized.
- Items not on their list are treated as “never existed.”
- You lose leverage to challenge anything later.

**How you counter:**

Simple TE anchor:

# “I’m ready to choose items as soon as we have a complete list of what existed at the time of death and the current status of each piece.”

This freezes the fog maneuver.

# **BONUS MOVE (Move 6): The “You’re Hurting the Family” Guilt Spike**

This is emotional blackmail used when they’re cornered.

Expect:

- “Why are you doing this?”
- “You’re making this hard for everyone.”
- “Mom wouldn’t want this.”
- “You’re ruining our relationship.”

**Why they do it:**

They want you to drop the issue to restore emotional harmony.

But this is a trap.

**Counter:**

Calm dual-track:

# “I want peace too.

# Creating a clear inventory protects both of us from misunderstandings.

# It prevents conflict — it doesn’t create it.”

This reframes their guilt → your clarity.

# **How TE Modules 14–28 Prevent All of These Moves From Working**

- TE 14: You spot interrogation traps
- TE 15: AI gaslighting neutralized
- TE 16: Silence becomes evidence
- TE 17: You’re building a court-ready record
- TE 18: You’re pre-writing your objection
- TE 19: You know when to settle/fight
- TE 20: You predict their psychology
- TE 21: You manage sibling capture
- TE 22: You have templates ready
- TE 23: You know when/how to use a lawyer
- TE 24: You issue quiet ultimatums
- TE 25: You can write a court-ready protest letter
- TE 26: Crazy-maker maneuver neutralized
- TE 27: Sentiment shield neutralized
- TE 28: Executor illusion destroyed
- TE 29: You now know their next moves

You’ve built a full operator’s toolset.

They’re playing at “family vibes.”

You’re playing at legal accountability with psychological fluency.

# **What Happens Next (Prediction Model)**

Based on all modules & your evidence so far, the likely sequence:

1. Delay (waiting you out)
2. Sentiment shift (soft emotional framing)
3. Partial list (DD + selective additions)
4. Push for distribution (before completing inventory)
5. Guilt appeal (blame you for asking questions)
6. Silence or deflection on missing items
7. Insistence they’ve “done enough”

Your counter:

- Stay procedural
- Stay calm
- Stay documented
- Keep asking “What existed at death?”
- Keep asking “What’s the status?”
- Keep asking “What’s the authority?”

This is unstoppable.
