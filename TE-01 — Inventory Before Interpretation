**You cannot divide what you have not identified.**

# **CORE PRINCIPLE**

Every estate problem — every argument, every misunderstanding, every accusation of favoritism, every moment of “Where did that go?” — begins with one missing step:

👉 No one made a complete inventory.

This module teaches the foundational rule of T&E Calculus:

# Inventory comes before everything else — before valuation, before distribution, before discussion, and before emotion.

You cannot divide, value, insure, or protect an estate that hasn’t been listed.

This is the structural failure behind most small-estate disasters.

# **WHY THIS MATTERS**

Without a verified inventory:

- Executors make decisions in the dark
- Beneficiaries feel suspicious (and often with good reason)
- Valuable items “go missing”
- Sentimental items get taken first
- Lawyers get involved unnecessarily
- Fees burn estate assets
- Relationships rupture

Most small estates don’t need lawyers — they need clarity.

And clarity begins with a list.

# **THE INVENTORY RULE**

In T&E Calculus, the first mandatory step is:

# List every asset before deciding anything about it.

Not value it.

Not divide it.

Not fight about it.

Not interpret the will.

Just list it.

This single rule prevents 80% of estate disputes.

# **WHAT GOES INTO A SMALL-ESTATE INVENTORY**

**1. Cash & Accounts**

- Checking
- Savings
- CDs
- Online accounts (PayPal, Venmo, brokerage apps)

**2. Jewelry**

High-value items first:

- Rings
- Earrings
- Watches
- Necklaces
- Bracelets

(Prior appraisals should be added — like your Exhibit A.)

**3. Artwork & Collectibles**

- Paintings
- Sculptures
- Signed pieces
- Limited editions

(Estate documents already provide this — Exhibit B.)

**4. Vehicles**

- Cars
- Boats
- Motorcycles
- Titles & VINs

**5. Household Items**

- Furniture
- Decor
- Kitchenware
- Tools
- Books
- Clothing

(Photograph room-by-room — fast and effective.)

**6. Digital Assets**

- Email
- Cloud accounts
- Photos
- Social media
- Online wallets

**7. Sentimental Items**

Low financial value, high emotional value:

- Photos
- Diaries
- Keepsakes

These often cause the most pain if not listed early.

# **THE T&E CALCULUS INVENTORY METHOD**

Follow this sequence:

**Step 1 — Walk the residence.**

Use your phone.

Room-by-room.

10 minutes per room.

**Step 2 — Extract from documents.**

Check:

- Appraisals
- Insurance packets
- Estate binders
- Tax returns
- Safe deposit entries
- Prior inventories

You already mastered this with Exhibits A & B.

**Step 3 — Build the master list.**

Use the Notion Inventory Database.

Each entry gets:

- Name
- Category
- Location
- Status (Located / Missing / Contended)
- Notes
- Attachments (photos, PDFs)

**Step 4 — Identify “valuation required” items.**

Mark only the items that need real appraisals.

**Step 5 — Confirm with all heirs.**

Send a simple message:

# “Attached is the complete inventory.

# Please review and confirm items or note anything missing.”

This stops 90% of future disputes.

# **T&E CALCULUS WARNING**

Never accept a distribution proposal before a full inventory.

Executors who try to “just settle it quickly” without inventory are almost always:

- Unprepared
- Avoiding transparency
- Playing favorites
- Or unaware of their duties

Inventory protects everyone, including the executor.

# **ASSIGNMENT (TE-01)**

(For families AND lawyers)

**Task:**

Create a complete inventory of the estate using:

- Photos
- Appraisals
- Estate schedule
- Existing exhibits
- The Notion database

**Checklist:**

- All assets entered
- Jewelry list inserted
- Artwork list inserted
- Bank accounts logged
- Vehicles documented
- Digital assets included
- Sentimental items added
- All documents uploaded

**Upload:**

Add all supporting documents to the “File Repository” section.

# **MODEL ANSWER (TE-01)**

Here is what a correct TE-01 submission looks like:

# “Completed the full estate inventory.

# Added 194 items including:

# 21 jewelry pieces (per Exhibit A)

# 24 artworks (per Exhibit B)

# 3 bank accounts

# 1 car

# 148 household items

# 17 sentimental items

# Uploaded: jewelry appraisal packet, art binder, Schedule B, and photos of each room.

# All items have status tags (Located / Missing / Contended).

# Inventory now ready for valuation (TE-02).”

This is the blueprint for the entire estate process.
