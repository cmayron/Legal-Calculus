**A fiduciary is a temporary manager, not the heir-in-chief.**

# **CORE PRINCIPLE**

One of the most dangerous misunderstandings in small estates is this:

# “The executor is in charge, so the executor decides.”

No.

The executor does not decide the outcome — the executor manages the process.

An executor is a fiduciary, not an owner.

They have duties, not privileges.

They administer the estate — they don’t absorb it.

Whether the executor is a sibling, spouse, child, or lawyer:

their power is administrative, never personal.

# **WHY THIS MATTERS**

Most estate conflicts begin when the executor behaves as if:

- They have superior rights
- They can allocate items unilaterally
- They can delay transparency
- They can choose what “equal” means
- They can interpret the will or trust however they want
- They get to help themselves first
- They can bill the estate for defensive legal advice

This is executor overreach.

It is extremely common.

And it is exactly why T&E Calculus exists.

# **THE FIDUCIARY STANDARD**

Under trust & estate law, an executor must:

**1. Act impartially**

They must treat all beneficiaries equally unless the will or trust expressly says otherwise.

**2. Act in good faith**

No self-dealing.

No selective transparency.

No delays that benefit one party over another.

**3. Provide information**

Inventories, documents, appraisals, and status updates are mandatory, not optional.

**4. Protect assets**

They must safeguard property until distribution, including:

- Maintaining insurance
- Securing valuables
- Preventing loss or theft
- Documenting who has access

**5. Keep complete records**

Appraisals, emails, receipts, and logs must be preserved and producible.

**6. Account for every asset**

Every item listed in the will, trust, or appraisal packet must be:

- Located
- Accounted for
- Explained if missing

Failure to do this is a breach of fiduciary duty.

# **THE “EXECUTOR ≠ OWNER” RULE**

Executors may hold estate assets, but they do not own them.

They cannot:

- pre-select items for themselves,
- “offer” others a check in place of a real share,
- deny access to valuations,
- hide inventories,
- or use the estate’s lawyer to justify unequal treatment.

Executorship is a temporary job, not a promotion.

# **WHAT AN EXECUTOR CAN DO (AND MUST DO)**

- Collect assets
- Pay legitimate debts
- Prepare an inventory
- Obtain appraisals
- File required notices
- Safeguard property
- Communicate with beneficiaries
- Distribute the estate according to the will or trust
- Provide a final accounting
- Close the estate account

That’s it.

Anything outside this scope is not discretion — it is misconduct.

# **WHAT AN EXECUTOR CANNOT DO**

A non-exhaustive list that appears in law, practice, and real-world estate disputes:

**❌ Hide or delay inventories**

**❌ “Cherry-pick” high-value items**

**❌ Allocate items without consent**

**❌ Use estate funds to defend personal actions**

**❌ Ignore valuations**

**❌ Decide what “equal” means**

**❌ “Forget” appraisals**

**❌ Treat estate assets as their own property**

**❌ Exclude or silence beneficiaries**

**❌ Claim not to have core documents**

Any of these behaviors is a red flag — and repeated behaviors establish a pattern of breach.

# **THE T&E CALCULUS METHOD FOR MANAGING EXECUTORS**

**Step 1 — Ask for an Inventory (TE-01)**

If you do not receive one, that is a breach flag.

**Step 2 — Ask for Status Tags**

Located / Missing / Contended.

**Step 3 — Request Insurance Confirmation**

If contents are unprotected, that’s a breach flag.

**Step 4 — File Everything in the Compliance Tracker**

Late, incomplete, or evasive responses are recorded.

**Step 5 — If necessary, send a Fee-Objection Notice**

Executors cannot use estate money to hide their own failures.

**Step 6 — Build Exhibits (A & B) from their own documents**

This removes their ability to deny knowledge.

**Step 7 — Use calm, precise, dated communications**

Anger helps them.

Documentation protects you.

**Step 8 — If breach pattern continues → accounting petition**

A last resort, but highly effective.

# **CASE NOTE (REAL WORLD EXAMPLE)**

(This is included in the module as a practical teaching moment.)

When counsel for the executor asked:

# “Where did you obtain the appraisal?”

— this revealed that the executor’s lawyer did not have the estate’s appraisal packets.

This is a powerful signal of:

- disorganization,
- improper record keeping,
- lack of inventory,
- and fiduciary failure.

The correct Legal Calculus move was executed:

- Respond calmly
- Cite their own documents
- Re-attach them
- Reinforce the deadline
- Add a fee-objection reminder

This is textbook T&E Calculus.

# **ASSIGNMENT (TE-02)**

**Task:**

Identify any behavior in your estate that constitutes executor overreach.

**Checklist:**

- Delays?
- Missing documents?
- Missing inventory?
- Unexplained “possession”?
- Demands without transparency?
- Attempts to define “equal” as unilateral?
- Lack of insurance?
- Use of estate funds to cover defensive counsel?

**Upload:**

Document your findings in the Fiduciary Compliance Tracker.

# **MODEL ANSWER (TE-02)**

# “Executor failed to produce inventory despite multiple requests; counsel admitted not to have core valuation documents; no insurance confirmation provided; unilateral decision-making attempted; estate funds being used for adversarial legal work. These constitute multiple breach indicators.”
