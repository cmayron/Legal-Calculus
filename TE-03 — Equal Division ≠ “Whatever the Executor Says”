**Fairness requires process, not personality.**

# **CORE PRINCIPLE**

In small estates, “equal” is often weaponized.

A self-interested executor will say:

# “Don’t worry, everything will be equal.”

But then:

- They choose what they want.
- They decide what others get.
- They assign you a dollar amount.
- They refuse to inventory first.
- They claim discretion.
- They stall transparency.

This is not equal division.

This is executive control disguised as fairness.

Legal Calculus calls this:

# The Equal Division Fallacy — when the executor claims equality while structuring inequality.

# **WHAT EQUAL ACTUALLY MEANS IN ESTATE LAW**

**Equal ≠ Cash substitute chosen unilaterally**

**Equal ≠ Executor picks first**

**Equal ≠ Whatever remains after their choices**

**Equal ≠ Executor’s subjective judgment**

**Equal ≠ “You get money, I get items”**

**Equal ≠ Silence + stalling + selective access**

Equal actually means:

# Each beneficiary has an equal opportunity to receive items, value, and information.

This requires process, not personality.

# **THE THREE RULES OF TRUE EQUAL DIVISION**

# **Rule 1: Inventory before allocation**

No distribution can occur until every item is listed and accounted for.

This is why TE-01 exists.

# **Rule 2: Valuation before selection**

Beneficiaries cannot choose fairly without knowing what things are worth.

Estate-created valuations (like Exhibits A & B) are the gold standard.

# **Rule 3: Equal opportunity to choose**

True equal division uses one of the following:

**A. Alternating selections**

Each beneficiary picks in turn.

**B. Category division**

Jewelry split by value.

Art split by value.

Furniture separate.

Cash used only to true-up small differences.

**C. Sentimental-first process**

Each beneficiary lists 3–5 sentimental items.

Resolve overlap first.

Then alternate picks.

**D. Appraisal-based equalization**

After both beneficiaries choose, a cash adjustment equalizes the final totals.

# **WHAT IS NOT EQUAL (RED FLAGS)**

**❌ Executor selecting items first**

**❌ Offering cash in lieu of items you want**

**❌ Refusing to divide by category**

**❌ Hiding or delaying inventory**

**❌ Keeping appraisals from beneficiaries**

**❌ Claiming “discretion” to choose for everyone**

**❌ Rebranding self-interest as “efficiency”**

**❌ Saying “stop asking questions”**

**❌ Pretending estate valuations don’t exist**

**❌ Using estate-paid lawyers to defend unequal plans**

These behaviors signal breach, not “equal division.”

# **THE T&E CALCULUS EQUAL-DIVISION METHOD**

A beneficiary must insist on a process that prevents manipulation:

**Step 1 — Inventory (TE-01)**

Everything listed.

Everything documented.

**Step 2 — Valuation (Exhibits A & B)**

Use the estate’s own appraisals.

**Step 3 — Confirm who is choosing**

Both beneficiaries choose.

Not just the executor.

**Step 4 — Select a method (A–D above)**

The method becomes the structure, not the executor.

**Step 5 — Track values in real time**

Use Notion’s running totals.

**Step 6 — Equalize with cash only at the end**

After all picks are made, not before.

**Step 7 — Document agreement**

Receipt & Release signed by all.

# **CASE NOTE (REAL WORLD EXAMPLE)**

(This module draws directly from your experience to illustrate the principle.)

In your estate:

# The planning attorney (Ellyn) wrote:“Everything is going to be divided equally between you and Michele.”

- The estate has fully documented valuation packets
(Exhibit A: $228,613 jewelry; Exhibit B: Artwork).

Yet the executor:

- withheld inventory,
- stalled transparency,
- attempted to define “equal” as “executor chooses; beneficiary gets a check,”
- asked where the estate’s own appraisals came from,
- and used counsel to delay and deflect.

This is the exact scenario TE-03 warns against.

The correct Calculus move was executed:

- Build Exhibits A & B
- Demand status confirmations (Located / Missing / Contended)
- Demand insurance
- Demand transparency
- Reject unilateral “equalization”
- Set deadlines
- Reserve fee-objection rights.

This is how equal division becomes real, not rhetorical.

# **ASSIGNMENT (TE-03)**

**Task:**

Select the method of equal division you believe is most appropriate for your estate and justify your choice.

**Checklist:**

- Inventory complete
- Valuation confirmed
- Method selected: A, B, C, or D
- Reason: fairness / practicality / sentimental distribution
- Draft a short distribution plan
- Upload to Notion

# **MODEL ANSWER (TE-03)**

# “Given the number of individually appraised jewelry items and artworks (Exhibits A and B), Method A — alternating picks — is the fairest. Both beneficiaries will select items based on full valuation transparency, with cash used only at the end to equalize totals. This adheres to Ellyn’s written equal-division guidance and prevents unilateral decision-making.”
