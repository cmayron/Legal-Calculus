**If they won’t provide the truth, you build it and make it undeniable.**

**CORE PRINCIPLE**

In Trust & Estate disputes, the biggest advantage an executor has is ambiguity:

- “We’re still looking for that.”
- “I don’t have those appraisals.”
- “We’ll address that later.”
- “It wasn’t part of the estate.”
- “Equal doesn’t need a list.”
- “December is busy.”

T&E Calculus rejects ambiguity completely.

Instead, we use exhibits — structured packets of evidence — to:

- Set the factual baseline
- Remove their ability to deny knowledge
- Lock in the record
- Force fiduciary accountability
- Prevent story changes
- Create a foundation for settlement
- And protect against future abuse

Exhibits turn their silence into your strength.

# **WHAT AN EXHIBIT IS (IN T&E CALCULUS)**

An Exhibit is:

- A packet
- Of documents already in the estate’s possession
- Organized clearly
- With a cover sheet
- Itemized tables
- Valuations
- Citations
- And a demand for fiduciary confirmation

It transforms loose papers into a legal object they cannot ignore.

# **WHY EXHIBITS WORK**

Executors and their lawyers cannot dismiss:

- Their own appraisals
- Their own valuation packets
- Their own binders
- Their own insurance schedules
- Their own Schedule B
- Their own emails
- Their own omissions

An exhibit is not your “opinion.”

It is their failure to perform documented in their own words and files.

When you send an exhibit, you are saying:

# “Here is what you should have had. I have it.

# Now you must answer.”

There is no escape route.

# **THE THREE TYPES OF EXHIBITS**

**Exhibit A — Jewelry Package**

Includes:

- Itemized list
- Appraisals
- Estate’s own valuations
- Photos (if available)
- Status grid
- Deadline
- Fee objection notice (if necessary)

This forces the executor to explain missing high-value items.

**Exhibit B — Artwork Package**

Includes:

- Schedule B
- 2025 appraisal packet
- Valuation binder
- Cover sheet
- Itemized list
- Status grid
- Insurance requirement

This makes denial or silence impossible.

**Exhibit C — Communications & Compliance Log**

Includes:

- Your emails
- Their replies
- Deadlines
- Failures to produce
- Red flags
- Insurance questions
- File requests

This is the foundation of a surcharge or accounting petition.

# **THE LEGAL CALCULUS “FREEZE THE RECORD” METHOD**

**Step 1 — Gather every estate-created document**

Appraisals, binders, Schedules, valuations, insurance records.

**Step 2 — Build an exhibit packet**

Include:

- Cover sheet
- Summary valuation
- Itemized list
- Citations
- Source documents
- Attachments
- Status request grid

**Step 3 — Send calmly, in writing, with a deadline**

Tone = professional

Content = factual

Deadline = firm

**Step 4 — Use CC to eliminate excuses**

Executor must see it.

Counsel must see it.

No triangulation.

**Step 5 — Wait for the breach**

Most executors either:

- Stall,
- Or ignore,
- Or partially produce (which is an admission),
- Or get defensive,
- Or ask questions that reveal they’re disorganized.

All of these become evidence.

**Step 6 — Preserve the silence**

Follow-up email after the deadline:

# “I am following up on the outstanding confirmations.”

Short, cold, perfect.

**Step 7 — Build Exhibit C (Compliance Log)**

Every failure becomes a line item.

This is the estate equivalent of “the appeal starts early.”

# **CASE NOTE (REAL WORLD EXAMPLE)**

This module is modeled directly on your recent move.

You created:

- Exhibit A (Jewelry ZIP)
- Exhibit B (Artwork ZIP)

These were built from:

- The Estate Valuation Packet
- Estate Jewelry Summary
- 2025 Art Appraisal Packet
- Schedule B
- The Artwork Valuation Binder

When Bruce asked:

# “Where did you get the appraisal?”

He exposed:

- He doesn’t have the estate documents
- The executor did not provide them to him
- The estate is being administered without its own inventory
- He is advising with incomplete information

Your response:

- Calm
- Precise
- Reattached the documents
- Reinforced deadline
- Reasserted fee objection
- CC’ed Michele

→ This is textbook TE-04.

You froze the record.

Now every future failure becomes a breach indicator.
