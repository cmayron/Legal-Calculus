**Value first, emotions second. Conflicts shrink when numbers come before narratives.**

**CORE PRINCIPLE**

In any estate — big or small — conflict grows in the vacuum left by missing numbers.

People fight over:

- What an item “means”
- What it “should be worth”
- What the decedent “wanted”
- What is “fair”

But T&E Calculus replaces emotion with structure:

# Valuation must occur before any distribution discussion.

You don’t divide until you know what you’re dividing.

Valuation is the antidote to:

- Suspicion
- Memory disputes
- Selective honesty
- Executor control
- Family narrative battles

Numbers remove noise.

# **WHY VALUATION MATTERS**

**Equity requires a baseline.**

You can’t have equal distribution without a valuation foundation.

**Executors must know the value to administer the estate properly.**

Missing, outdated, or absent valuations = breach flags.

**Beneficiaries gain power through documentation.**

When you have the numbers, you remove their discretion.

**Appraisals protect against self-dealing.**

Executors cannot “estimate” selectively or undervalue what they want.

**Valuation prevents future family resentment.**

People accept outcomes more easily when they are based on documented, neutral facts.

# **THE THREE LEVELS OF ESTATE VALUATION**

**Level 1: Estate-Created Valuations (Strongest)**

These are the gold standard:

- Formal appraisals
- Insurance schedules
- Estate valuation packets
- Schedule B
- Prior binder appraisals

These are already accepted by law, courts, and accountants.

# Your Exhibit A (jewelry) and Exhibit B (artwork) are perfect examples.

They are irrefutable because they come from the estate’s own file.

**Level 2: Neutral Third-Party Valuations**

Used when:

- Items weren’t previously appraised
- Values have significantly changed
- The executor or beneficiary disputes the amount

Examples:

- Updated art appraisal
- Updated jewelry appraisal
- Estate sale estimators
- Classic car valuations
- Antique dealer assessments
- Gold/precious metal weight assessments

These are used to supplement, not replace, estate-produced valuations.

**Level 3: Informal Valuation (for low-value items)**

Used for:

- Furniture
- Clothing
- Kitchenware
- Books
- Small electronics
- Household goods

Tools:

- Craigslist / eBay comps
- Goodwill value charts
- Estate sale company estimates

Used for efficiency, not precision.

# **VALUATION IN T&E CALCULUS**

**Step 1 — Divide assets into categories**

A. High-value items

- Jewelry
- Artwork
- Watches
- Rare collections
- Antiques
- Vehicles

→ Must use Level 1 or Level 2 valuation

B. Medium-value items

- Furniture sets
- Electronics
- Instruments

→ Level 2 or Level 3

C. Low-value items

- Clothes
- Books
- Common household goods

→ Level 3 only

**Step 2 — Upload documents into the Valuation Repository**

This includes:

- PDFs
- Photos
- Binders
- Insurance schedules
- Screenshots
- Emails from planners/appraisers
- Anything showing numbers

**Step 3 — Convert to a valuation table**

Use Notion’s Valuation Database:

Columns:

- Item
- Category
- Source (Estate / Appraiser / Online comp)
- Value (Range allowed)
- Notes
- Attachments

This creates a single source of truth.

**Step 4 — Identify discrepancies**

Executors often:

- Understate what they want
- Overstate what you want
- Ignore estate-created valuations
- Delay updated appraisals

When your numbers are based on their own documents, disputes evaporate.

**Step 5 — Freeze valuation in an exhibit**

If valuation becomes a conflict area:

- Include valuations in Exhibit A or B
- Cite estate-produced sources
- Demand appraisal confirmation
- Require any challenges be documented in writing

# Remind executor:“Estate funds cannot be used to dispute established estate valuations.”

This stops them from claiming ignorance or inventing new numbers.

# **CASE NOTE (REAL WORLD EXAMPLE)**

In your case:

- The jewelry valuation packet totaled $228,613
- The art valuations totaled $85,000 (1991) and $37,900–$75,000 (2025)
- All valuations were produced by the estate, not you

# Bruce asked:“Where did you get the appraisal?”

This revealed:

- He did not have the estate’s own documents
- The executor did not provide them
- The estate was being administered without valuation
- His position became indefensible

Your move — Exhibits A and B — immediately froze the record.

Now valuation cannot be dismissed, minimized, or delayed.
