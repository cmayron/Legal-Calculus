**The estate isn’t settled by feelings — it’s settled by the written record.**

# **CORE PRINCIPLE**

In Trust & Estate conflicts, communication is not conversation.

Executors often rely on:

- Silence
- Delay
- Vague promises
- “We’ll get back to you”
- Holiday excuses
- Shifting statements
- Phone calls without written follow-up

This is intentional.

It keeps everything unstructured, undefinable, unverifiable, and unaccountable.

T&E Calculus flips this dynamic completely.

# Communication is not for resolving emotion.

# Communication is for building the record.

The goal is not to “talk it out.”

The goal is to produce a clear sequence of dated, documented steps that any lawyer, judge, or mediator can follow instantly.

# **WHY STRUCTURED COMMUNICATION MATTERS**

**1. Executors cannot weaponize ambiguity when the record is clean.**

Silence becomes evidence.

Delay becomes evidence.

Vague responses become evidence.

**2. You prevent story changes.**

A well-written email stops future revision:

# “I never said that.”

**3. You force professionalism.**

Even difficult executors have to step out of emotional mode when the correspondence is formal.

**4. You prepare for every outcome.**

Settlement or escalation — your record is ready.

**5. You protect yourself emotionally.**

You are no longer reacting to behavior.

You are following a protocol.

# **THE T&E CALCULUS COMMUNICATION METHOD**

There are 5 rules that govern every message.

# **Rule 1 — Everything is written.**

No important communication happens by phone without a follow-up email.

You can always write:

# “Following up on our conversation earlier today, I want to confirm…”

This prevents:

- Misinterpretation
- Gaslighting
- Excuses
- Denials

# **Rule 2 — Tone is calm, professional, neutral.**

Executors often try to provoke emotional reactions.

It helps their narrative.

Your tone must always be:

- Short
- Clean
- Unemotional
- Procedural

T&E Calculus tone template:

# “Thank you for your note.

# I am writing to confirm…”

# “Please provide…”

# “Attached for your convenience…”

# “As previously requested…”

Executors hate this because they cannot fight it.

# **Rule 3 — Every message contains a structure.**

A proper estate communication has:

1. Purpose
2. Context
3. Request
4. Deadline
5. Documentation

Example:

# “Attached is Exhibit B.

# Please provide Located / Missing / Contended status for each artwork by December 15.”

That’s structure.

Executors cannot wiggle out of structure.

# **Rule 4 — CC the executor on all estate counsel emails.**

This eliminates:

- “I wasn’t aware”
- “He never told me”
- “That’s between you and the lawyer”

The executor MUST see what is being said in their name.

# **Rule 5 — No emotion. The record is your voice.**

You don’t need:

- Debate
- Justifications
- Arguments
- Explanations

You only need:

- Documentation
- Precision
- Patience
- Deadlines

This wins every estate dispute.

# **THE COMMUNICATION TEMPLATES (BUILT INTO T&E CALCULUS)**

Every small estate needs 6 templates:

**1. Inventory Request**

Professional and neutral.

**2. Status Confirmation Request**

(L/M/C: Located / Missing / Contended)

**3. Fee-Objection Notice**

A powerful tool that stops misuse of estate funds.

**4. Follow-Up After Silence**

One sentence:

# “Following up on the outstanding request below.”

**5. Distribution Proposal**

Used once valuation is complete.

**6. Final Confirmation & Release**

Used at closing.

Each template is in your Notion library.

# **CASE NOTE (REAL WORLD EXAMPLE)**

When Bruce wrote:

# “We have a lot going on… it’s the holiday season… I will respond in due course.”

This was:

- A stall
- An attempt to reset your timeline
- An attempt to reclaim control
- A signal that he did not want to answer the substance

Your response was a perfect TE-06 application:

- Calm
- Not reactive
- Short
- To the point
- Reattached documents
- Reinforced deadline
- Pointed out his lack of estate documents
- CC’d Michele

This turned his stall into evidence.

That is communication as structure.

# **ASSIGNMENT (TE-06)**

**Task:**

Send one structured communication using Rules 1–5.

Use:

- Inventory request
- Artwork status request
- Insurance request
- Fee objection reminder
- Follow-up after silence

**Checklist:**

- Purpose stated
- Facts summarized
- Attachments included
- Deadline set
- CC’ed executor
- Tone = factual

**Upload:**

Copy the email into the Communications Log.

# **MODEL ANSWER (TE-06)**

# “Attached is Exhibit B.

# Please provide status for each artwork by December 19.

# Given that these documents come directly from the Estate’s file, failure to produce a corresponding inventory will be recorded as a fiduciary compliance issue.

# Thank you.

# CC: Executor.”

This is exactly how the system protects itself.
