**Fairness is not a feeling — it is a method.**

**CORE PRINCIPLE**

Most estates fall apart not because of money, but because of how items are divided.

The moment distribution becomes:

- “I get this first.”
- “You can take whatever is left.”
- “It’s not worth much.”
- “Let me just cut you a check.”
- “Stop asking questions.”
- “You’re being difficult.”

…fairness collapses.

T&E Calculus fixes this by offering four proven distribution systems that eliminate favoritism, bias, uncertainty, and emotional manipulation.

Each method:

- reduces conflict,
- protects sentimental value,
- equalizes by documented value,
- and prevents the executor from hijacking the process.

# **THE FOUR T&E CALCULUS DISTRIBUTION MODELS**

These are the methods used by mediators, estate planners, and trust lawyers in real settlements — simplified, structured, and free.

# **MODEL A — Alternating Picks (The Gold Standard)**

**Equal opportunity → equal outcome.**

How it works:

1. All items are inventoried and valued (TE-01, TE-05).
2. Beneficiaries alternate choosing items.
3. Values are tracked in real time.
4. Cash adjusts the difference at the end.

Why it works:

- Removes power imbalance
- Protects sentimental items
- Simple, transparent, fair
- Impossible for executor to manipulate
- Zero ambiguity

This is ideal when:

- Both beneficiaries want physical items
- Valuations are clear
- Sentimental items matter
- There is distrust of executor behavior

# **MODEL B — Category Division**

**Divide categories separately, then true-up.**

Examples:

- Jewelry split equally by value
- Artwork split equally
- Furniture split separately
- Digital assets handled separately

Why it works:

- Prevents “one person takes all the jewelry”
- Prevents “one person takes all the artwork”
- Enables each category to be settled independently

Ideal for estates like yours with:

- High-value jewelry (Exhibit A)
- High-value artwork (Exhibit B)
- Distinct asset clusters

# **MODEL C — Sentimental-First Process**

**Protects emotional items before value items.**

How it works:

1. Each heir lists 3–5 personal/sentimental items.
2. Overlaps are negotiated first.
3. All sentimental items are resolved before valuation-based picks.
4. Then alternate picks begin.

Why it works:

- Prevents emotional damage
- Stops siblings from taking items “out of spite”
- Ensures no one loses irreplaceable keepsakes

This is ideal when:

- Family history matters
- Items have low monetary value but high emotional weight
- Avoiding emotional harm is top priority (Lisa’s situation)

# **MODEL D — Appraisal-Based Cash-Out (Only After Process)**

**Not “executor offers you a check,” but a neutral, documented cash equalization.**

How it works:

1. Full inventory (TE-01)
2. Full appraisal (TE-05)
3. Written consent of all beneficiaries
4. Executor distributes cash equal to the documented share

Why it works:

- Prevents executor from cherry-picking
- Keeps distributions clean
- Useful when heirs live far away
- Useful when physical division isn’t practical

Important:

This is the last method — never the first.

Executors often try to flip this model upside-down:

# “I’ll keep the jewelry, you get a check.”

T&E Calculus rejects that.

Cash equalization only happens after transparent valuation and selection.

# **HOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT MODEL**

Use this 4-step decision tree:

**Step 1 — Are sentimental items significant?**

If yes → Model C first, then A or B.

**Step 2 — Are there distinct categories?**

If yes → Model B + cash true-up.

**Step 3 — Do both people want physical items?**

If yes → Model A (gold standard).

**Step 4 — Does one person prefer cash?**

If yes → Model D, but only after A–C are complete.

# **THE T&E CALCULUS ANTI-MANIPULATION RULE**

# No distribution method begins until the executor confirms inventory and valuation.

# Any attempt to distribute before these steps is a breach flag.

This prevents:

- unilateral decisions
- “executor picks first”
- under-the-table removals
- “you just get money” tactics
- sentimental weaponization

# **CASE NOTE (REAL WORLD EXAMPLE)**

In your estate:

- Jewelry (Exhibit A) = $228,613
- Artwork (Exhibit B) = 24 pieces with documented valuations
- Executor tried to reinterpret “equal” into her definition
- Tried to skip inventory
- Tried to cash-out without selection
- Tried to delay

This is exactly the conflict TE-09 resolves.

The appropriate methods here are:

- Model B (category division) for jewelry and art
- Model A or C for sentimental items
- Model D only after valuation and selection

Your deadline-based emails and exhibits already set this up perfectly.

# **ASSIGNMENT (TE-09)**

**Task:**

Choose the distribution method(s) that fit your estate and draft a 1-paragraph plan.

**Checklist:**

- Inventory complete
- Valuation confirmed
- Categories identified
- Distribution method chosen
- Deadline set for response
- Plan added to Notion

**Upload:**

Place your distribution plan in the Distribution Planner page.

# **MODEL ANSWER (TE-09)**

# “Given the estate’s structure, I propose Model B (Category Division) for jewelry and artwork, followed by Model A (Alternating Picks) for any sentimental items. Cash true-up will occur only at the end. This aligns with Ellyn’s written equal-division guidance and prevents unilateral decision-making.”
