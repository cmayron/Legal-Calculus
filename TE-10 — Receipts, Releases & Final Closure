**The estate is not done when items are handed out — it’s done when the paper says it’s done.**

# **CORE PRINCIPLE**

Most estates fail in the last 5% of the process.

Why?

Because families think:

- “We already divided everything.”
- “We’re basically done.”
- “Let’s just move on.”

But without formal closure, you remain legally exposed and emotionally entangled.

Executors rely on this — they hand things out informally, avoid documentation, then disappear.

T&E Calculus teaches:

# Distribution without documentation is not closure — it is a risk.

Real closure requires two documents:

1. Receipt of Property
2. Release of Claims

Both must be signed by all beneficiaries.

This protects everyone.

# **THE THREE COMPONENTS OF FINAL CLOSURE**

# **1. Distribution Summary**

This is a simple ledger showing:

- All items distributed
- All cash equalizations
- All sentimental items
- All valuations
- All beneficiaries’ shares

It confirms:

# What each person actually received.

This avoids future “you got more” accusations.

# **2. Receipt of Property**

This document states:

- The beneficiary received the listed items
- The items listed are correct
- The beneficiary acknowledges delivery
- The executor delivered them as promised
- The beneficiary will not dispute the delivery later

This protects the executor.

It is a required shield.

# **3. Release of Claims**

This is the beneficiary stating:

- “I am satisfied with my share”
- “I have no further claims against the executor”
- “I accept the distributions as final”
- “I will not reopen the estate later”

This protects the beneficiary.

It prevents executor manipulation afterward.

The Release is the true legal end of the estate.

# **WHAT A RELEASE DOES (AND DOES NOT DO)**

**✔ It closes the estate**

**✔ It protects beneficiaries**

**✔ It limits executor power**

**✔ It avoids future fights**

**✔ It prevents later claims of “you owe me something”**

**❌ It does NOT excuse fraud**

**❌ It does NOT excuse missing inventory**

**❌ It does NOT excuse breach of fiduciary duty**

**❌ It does NOT replace proper accounting**

**❌ It does NOT excuse misuse of estate funds**

A release is not a magic shield for wrongdoing.

It is a closure tool used after the estate has been properly administered.

# **THE T&E CALCULUS CLOSING METHOD**

**Step 1 — Completed Inventory**

Everything listed, valued, and accounted for.

**Step 2 — Completed Distribution Plan**

Chosen method applied (TE-09).

**Step 3 — Cash Equalization (If Needed)**

Only after the picks are complete.

**Step 4 — Distribution Summary Issued**

Executor sends a complete sheet showing:

- Jewelry distribution
- Artwork distribution
- Personal item distribution
- Cash true-ups
- Final totals per beneficiary

**Step 5 — Property Delivered**

Beneficiaries sign Receipt of Property.

**Step 6 — Release of Claims Signed**

Beneficiaries sign the Final Release.

**Step 7 — Executor Files Accounting**

Basic or formal depending on state requirements.

**Step 8 — Estate Bank Account Closed**

Funds moved, taxes filed, estate ends.

**Step 9 — Everything archived**

Stored in the Notion repository.

# **T&E CALCULUS RELEASE TEMPLATES**

Your Notion workspace includes:

**1. Receipt of Property**

- Beneficiary name
- List of items
- Sign/date
- Executor signature optional
- Witness or notary (if required)

**2. General Release**

- “I acknowledge receipt of my share.”
- “I release the Executor from claims related to distribution.”
- “This Release does not excuse fraud or undisclosed assets.”
- “I sign voluntarily.”
- Sign/date/notary as needed.

**3. Estate Closing Confirmation**

- Executor confirms estate account closure
- Confirms no outstanding liabilities
- Confirms all distributions performed
- Confirms all receipts and releases collected

This completes the estate.

# **CASE NOTE (REAL WORLD EXAMPLE)**

In your case:

- Exhibit A and Exhibit B provide documented valuations
- Distribution methods (TE-09) are already clear
- Inventory requests were sent
- Deadlines set
- Executor overreach noted
- Fee-objection notices in place

Once inventory and distribution are complete, your estate will need:

- Receipts (confirming jewelry/art/other assets delivered)
- Releases (preventing future disputes)
- Executor confirmation (closing out estate account)

Without these, Michele could attempt to:

- Reopen arguments
- Claim she delivered items she didn’t
- Claim you rejected items
- Claim the estate “still owes” administrative fees
- Claim issues with art/jewelry later
- Keep estate assets unaccounted for

T&E Calculus prevents all of that.

# **ASSIGNMENT (TE-10)**

**Task:**

Prepare the closing documents now (even if the estate isn’t ready yet):

- Fill out template Receipt of Property
- Fill out template Release
- Save to the “Closing Documents” section in Notion
- Leave blank lines for final valuations/dates

**Checklist:**

- Receipt drafted
- Release drafted
- Distribution summary table created
- Closing checklist added to Notion
- Templates stored for final use

# **MODEL ANSWER (TE-10)**

# “Prepared draft Receipt of Property and Release of Claims. Added Distribution Summary table to Notion and uploaded templates to the Closing Documents section. Estate will be ready for formal closure once inventory and distribution are complete.”
