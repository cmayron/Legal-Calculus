**The executor role is mechanical, not moral — but many executors confuse the two.**

# **CORE PRINCIPLE**

Executors often believe:

- “I know what’s best.”
- “I have discretion.”
- “I shouldn’t be questioned.”
- “My judgment is final.”

This is the executor’s blind spot — the moment the fiduciary begins treating authority as entitlement.

T&E Calculus teaches:

# A fiduciary’s personal feelings, preferences, or convenience are irrelevant.

# Only duties matter.

# **THE FOUR EXECUTOR BLIND SPOTS**

**1. Moral Superiority Blind Spot**

Executor thinks:

# “I’m the responsible one. I deserve more control.”

**2. Emotional Narrative Blind Spot**

Executor believes their story (“I did everything for Mom”) gives them extra rights.

**3. Convenience Blind Spot**

Executor acts based on what’s easiest, not what’s lawful.

**4. Control Blind Spot**

Executor sees questions as disrespect, not oversight.

# **T&E CALCULUS COUNTERMEASURE**

Use structured communication + exhibits to realign the executor with their duties.

# **ASSIGNMENT**

Document any “blind spot” behaviors in your estate.

# **TE-14 — Insurance, Access & Risk Management**

**Nothing accelerates litigation faster than an uninsured estate.**

# **CORE PRINCIPLE**

If workers, stagers, cleaners, or realtors enter the property without insurance, the executor is exposed to:

- loss
- damage
- theft
- liability
- surcharge

T&E Calculus rule:

# No third party enters the residence until contents are insured and COIs are obtained.

# **THE THREE INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS**

**1. Contents Insurance**

Covers jewelry, art, valuables.

**2. General Liability Insurance**

**(for contractors/stagers)**

Executor must obtain COIs naming the estate.

**3. Access Log**

Anyone entering must be recorded.

# **ASSIGNMENT**

Add your estate’s insurance status to the Compliance Tracker.

# **TE-15 — When Items Are “Missing”: The L/M/C System**

**Located / Missing / Contended: the status grid that forces honesty.**

# **CORE PRINCIPLE**

Executors avoid accountability by keeping asset status vague.

The L/M/C grid eliminates vagueness:

- L—Located
- M—Missing
- C—Contended (executor claims item not part of estate)

Once status is declared, the executor is locked in.

# **THE L/M/C METHOD**

**Step 1:**

**Send an exhibit with full item list.**

**Step 2:**

**Require status for each item.**

**Step 3:**

**Mark each item in database.**

**Step 4:**

**Missing items trigger immediate investigation.**

**Step 5:**

**Contended items require evidence.**

# **ASSIGNMENT**

Insert all jewelry + art into your L/M/C grid.

# **TE-16 — Mediation as a Cost-Saver, Not a Compromise of Truth**

**Mediation is not surrender — it’s structure with a referee.**

# **CORE PRINCIPLE**

Mediation is not:

- admitting you’re wrong
- giving the executor control
- reducing your rights

Mediation is:

# A structured conversation supervised by a neutral third party.

It is extremely effective in:

- emotional families
- sibling conflicts
- estates with miscommunication
- cases with partial inventories
- disputes over sentimental items

# **THE MEDIATION BENEFIT TRIAD**

1. Cost Reduction — far cheaper than litigation
2. Speed — settlements in hours or days
3. Neutral Reality Check — executor hears the truth from someone they cannot dismiss

# **ASSIGNMENT**

Add “mediation readiness” to your Distribution Plan.

# **TE-17 — The Accounting Petition: The Nuclear Option That Works**

**If the executor refuses transparency, the court forces it.**

# **CORE PRINCIPLE**

An accounting petition is the ultimate enforcement tool.

It compels the executor to:

- list every asset
- list every transaction
- explain every missing item
- produce bank statements
- justify all fees
- prove insurance
- disclose all distributions

Executors fear accountings because they expose mismanagement.

# **WHEN TO FILE**

- Missing items
- No inventory
- No accounting
- Misuse of funds
- Personal use of estate lawyer
- Refusal to answer written requests
- Delays > 60–90 days

# **WHAT THE PETITION PRODUCES**

A clean, court-ordered report:

- assets at death
- assets now
- losses
- gains
- fees
- receipts
- distributions

If wrongdoing is found → surcharge.

# **ASSIGNMENT**

Prepare a “Draft Accounting Request” in your Notion workspace.

# **TE-18 — Surcharge: When Executors Pay Back the Estate**

**Estate money used improperly must be returned personally.**

# **CORE PRINCIPLE**

A surcharge is the court ordering the executor to reimburse the estate for:

- missing items
- negligent losses
- excessive fees
- improper legal expenses
- self-dealing
- misuse of estate funds

This is personal liability.

Not paid by the estate.

Paid by the executor out of their own pocket.

Executors often become cooperative the moment surcharge is mentioned.

# **THE SURCHARGE CATEGORIES**

**1. Missing property**

Jewelry, artwork, valuables.

**2. Legal fees used against beneficiaries**

If estate funds pay for stall/deflect tactics → surcharge.

**3. Failure to insure**

Loss through negligence → surcharge.

**4. Unauthorized distributions**

Picking items first → surcharge.

**5. Failure to inventory**

Courts treat this as neglect → surcharge.

# **ASSIGNMENT**

Add a “Surcharge Risk” field to your Compliance Tracker.

# **TE-19 — Executor Removal (Rare but Necessary)**

**If behavior crosses certain lines, they lose the title.**

# **CORE PRINCIPLE**

Removing an executor is rare but absolutely possible when:

- they fail to perform fiduciary duties
- they obstruct settlement
- they act dishonestly
- they misuse estate funds
- they refuse inventory or accounting
- they cause estate losses

The law prioritizes estate integrity over executor feelings.

# **THE 6 REMOVAL GROUNDS**

1. Misconduct
2. Mismanagement
3. Neglect of duty
4. Incapacity or conflict of interest
5. Dishonesty
6. Hostility causing estate harm

# **HOW REMOVAL WORKS**

1. You file a petition.
2. Court reviews evidence.
3. Executor must respond under oath.
4. Court may appoint a neutral administrator.

Executors usually back down before removal ever reaches hearing.

# **ASSIGNMENT**

Add “Removal Grounds” as a hidden page for your own notes.

# **TE-20 — Preventing Estate Chaos Before It Begins**

**The best estate plan is one that never becomes a family conflict.**

# **CORE PRINCIPLE**

T&E Calculus doesn’t only resolve problems — it prevents them.

This module teaches the preventive strategies families should use while the testators are still alive (or early in administration), turning future estate chaos into clean order.

# **THE FIVE PILLARS OF ESTATE PREVENTION**

**1. Transparent Planning**

Parents must explain their intentions to all children.

**2. Updated Appraisals**

Valuations should be refreshed every 3–5 years.

**3. Inventory at Life Events**

Major life updates → update inventory.

**4. Clear Executor Instructions**

Executors must know:

- duties
- boundaries
- disclosures
- expectations

**5. Sibling Agreements**

A simple written agreement can eliminate future conflict:

# “We agree to divide equally using a structured method.”

# **THE PREVENTION KIT (T&E Edition)**

For future families:

- Inventory templates
- Valuation worksheets
- Distribution agreements
- Executor boundaries
- Triangulation safeguards
- TE-01 to TE-12 as a guide before death, not after

This turns T&E Calculus into a public health tool for families.

# **ASSIGNMENT (TE-20)**

Draft a 1-page prevention plan you would recommend to any family settling a small estate. Upload it to your Education section.

# **MODEL ANSWER (TE-20)**

# “Recommended that families maintain an updated inventory, periodic valuations, clear executor instructions, and a written agreement among heirs to use alternating-pick or category-split methods. Suggested avoiding triangulation and using transparent communication. Added these to the Education guide.”
