**How Their Choices Today Become Their Problems Later**

# **CORE PRINCIPLE**

Once you have:

- documented the assets (Schedules A & B),
- documented value (appraisal, photos, records),
- and documented refusals / avoidance,

you no longer need to fight.

From that point forward:

# *Every choice the executor makes either reduces or increases their own exposure.

# Your job is no longer to push — it’s to observe, document, and let their pattern develop.**

TE-34 shows how each category of misbehavior becomes a specific vulnerability in any accounting, fee request, or surcharge proceeding.

# **1. EXPOSURE CATEGORY #1 — NO INVENTORY**

Behavior:

- Executor never created a real inventory.
- Denied or ignored Schedules A & B.
- Refused to tag assets as Located / Missing / Distributed.

Exposure:

- Breach of duty to marshal and account.
- Judge sees:
    - “Beneficiary did the work; executor refused to adopt or improve it.”
    - Inference: disorganization, concealment, or both.
- 

How it hurts them later:

- Accounts and petitions are treated skeptically.
- Their “I didn’t know” argument collapses — your schedules prove they knew.
- Surcharge becomes easier whenever assets are missing or underreported.

# **2. EXPOSURE CATEGORY #2 — JEWELRY GAPS**

Behavior:

- Jewelry not inventoried.
- Only partial list acknowledged (e.g., “5 of 20 pieces”).
- “Sentimental” used to dodge valuation and disclosure.
- Pieces taken by executor without documented distribution value.

Exposure:

- Unaccounted-for estate assets.
- Self-dealing.
- Failure to preserve and account.

How it hurts them later:

- In an accounting:
    - Question: “Where are these items?”
    - If no answer: “Executor to be surcharged $X for missing items.”
- 
- Even if the items still exist with executor:
    - Court may treat them as already distributed to executor at fair value and require equalization.
- 

# **3. EXPOSURE CATEGORY #3 — ART VALUE DENIAL**

Behavior:

- Art treated as décor, not assets.
- Prior appraisal packets ignored or “forgotten.”
- No effort to value artwork for distribution.
- Attempt to lump art into “house” without separate treatment.

Exposure:

- Concealment of material estate value.
- Failure to consider art in equalization.

How it hurts them later:

- Judge sees:
    - “There was a documented art appraisal.
    Beneficiary pointed to it.
    Executor didn’t incorporate it.”
- 
- Court may:
    - Impute art value into executor’s share,
    - Adjust distributions,
    - Or surcharge executor for value diverted.
- 

# **4. EXPOSURE CATEGORY #4 — STONEWALLING FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

Behavior:

- Refusal to list bank, brokerage, and cash accounts.
- Vague or no date-of-death balances.
- No transparency on estate cash flows.

Exposure:

- Suspicion of mismanagement or concealment.
- Insufficient accounting.

How it hurts them later:

- During accounting, judge can:
    - Demand full bank/brokerage statements.
    - Question unexplained withdrawals or transfers.
    - Treat incomplete disclosures as red flags.
- 
- If estate cash is missing or misapplied:
    - Surcharge follows.
- 

# **5. EXPOSURE CATEGORY #5 — USING ESTATE FUNDS AS A SHIELD**

Behavior:

- Estate money used to pay counsel for:
    - resisting inventory,
    - resisting valuation,
    - resisting disclosure,
    - attacking beneficiary instead of solving problems.
- 

Exposure:

- Improper use of estate funds.
- Fees not incurred for the estate’s benefit, but to mask or defend executor failures.

How it hurts them later:

- In fee review:
    - “These hours appear to be defensive, not administrative.”
- 
- Court can:
    - Disallow a portion of legal fees,
    - Treat them as executor’s personal responsibility,
    - Or reduce executor’s commissions.
- 

# **6. EXPOSURE CATEGORY #6 — HOSTILITY WITHOUT SUBSTANCE**

Behavior:

- Name-calling (“crazy,” “obsessive,” “misled”).
- Threats (“take us to court, judges like us”).
- No actual answer to:
    - inventory requests,
    - value questions,
    - equality concerns.
- 

Exposure:

- Loss of judicial sympathy.
- Judge sees:
    - “Beneficiary asked reasonable questions.
    Executor’s side responded with hostility and no substance.”
- 

How it hurts them later:

- In a close call, judges side with:
    - the documented, calm, reasonable party.
- 
- Executor’s credibility erodes.
- Court is more open to believing beneficiary’s version of the disputed facts.

# **7. HOW YOU USE THE EXPOSURE MAP (WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING NOW)**

TE-34 is not about acting now.

It’s about understanding what you’ve already set in motion.

You:

- Created Schedules A & B.
- Anchored value with an appraisal.
- Asked for inventory and banking.
- Received refusals and silence.
- Documented their behavior.

From now on:

- Every time they:
    - fail to inventory,
    - ignore value,
    - mishandle jewelry/art,
    - refuse disclosure,
    - misuse legal fees,
- 

they are adding to their exposure, not yours.

You don’t have to push.

You don’t have to remind.

You don’t have to warn.

You simply observe and save.

# **8. ASSIGNMENT (TE-34) — BUILD YOUR EXPOSURE MAP**

Task:

Create your own Executor Exposure Map using the categories above.

Checklist:

- List each area where the executor has refused or failed (inventory, jewelry, art, financials, fees).
- Under each, note:
    - What you did (Schedule, email, request).
    - What they did (or didn’t do).
    - What rule that implicates (marshal, account, disclose, preserve).
- 
- Tag each as:
    - Mild, Moderate, or Severe exposure.
- 

Upload:

Document this in your Fiduciary Compliance Tracker as:

# “TE-34 — Executor Exposure Map — [Estate Name].”

# **9. MODEL ENTRY (TE-34)**

# “Executor refused to adopt or improve jewelry inventory (Schedule A) or art list (Schedule B) despite receiving them with full appraisal context. Refused to provide estate account list or date-of-death balances. Counsel’s emails focus on discrediting beneficiary rather than answering questions. Estate funds appear to be used to resist inventory and disclosure rather than perform core fiduciary tasks.

# Exposure:

# Jewelry: Severe (unaccounted items + self-dealing risk)

# Art: Moderate–Severe (unvalued but documented)

# Cash/Banking: Moderate (opaque flows, correctable via accounting)

# Fees: Moderate (likely fee disallowance).”

TE-33 told you when to stop pushing.

TE-34 shows you why you can now safely step back and let their behavior generate its own consequences.
