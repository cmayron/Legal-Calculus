TNRPESC is your pre-filing vital signs—7 quick checks that make any filing safer and clearer.

Score 1 point per vital (max 7). If any are yellow/red, fix before you file.

T — Timely

What it asks: Did you meet the deadline, and can you prove it?

Proof: e-file receipt or USPS/FedEx postmark + tracking; §1746 mailing declaration.

Quick fix: Cite the mailbox/portal rule; attach the receipt/postmark.

N — Notice

What it asks: Did you give notice the rule requires (or properly certify ex parte)?

Proof: Notice paragraph + certificate (time/method/recipients); Rule 65(b) cert if TRO ex parte.

Quick fix: Add a short notice paragraph + certificate of notice.

R — Rule quoted

What it asks: Is the controlling rule/standard quoted or pinpoint-cited (not paraphrased), with jurisdiction?

Proof: Verbatim text or pinpoint citation (e.g., “Winter, 555 U.S. at 20”).

Quick fix: Paste the exact language; add circuit/court and pinpoints.

P — Preservation (paragraph)

What it asks: Do you have a 120–170-word paragraph that states the issue, standard, where the record preserves it, and the precise relief?

Proof: A standalone “Preservation of Issues” block with ECF/Ex. pinpoints.

Quick fix: Drop in the LC preservation paragraph template and fill the pinpoints.

E — Exhibits labeled

What it asks: Are exhibits clearly labeled and cited in-text with pinpoints?

Proof: “Ex. A at 2,” “Ex. B ¶7” in the brief; tabbed/renamed exhibit files.

Quick fix: Rename exhibits; add parenthetical pinpoints wherever you reference them.

S — Service certified

What it asks: Did you properly serve and add a Certificate of Service?

Proof: COS stating method, date/time, addresses/emails, and governing rule.

Quick fix: Append a COS; if dual-channel (mail + e-file), note both.

C — Changes logged (“What’s New”)

What it asks: Did you tell the court what changed since the last filing?

Proof: 2–3 bullets on page 1 or a footnote (e.g., new exhibit, corrected cite, narrowed relief).

Quick fix: Add “What’s New” bullets.

How to use it (fast)

Score: 6–7 = green; 4–5 = fix the yellows now; ≤3 = pause and stabilize (fix in order: T → N → R → P).

In the app: export is gated until all seven are green, or you explicitly accept a yellow/red with a reason (logged).

At hearing: if interrupted, anchor back to Relief → Standard (quoted) → Pinpoint → Narrow order and confirm TNRPESC is satisfied.

Mnemonic: Timely • Notice • Rule quoted • Preservation • Exhibits • Service • Changes.
