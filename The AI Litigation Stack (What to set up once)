1. Matter Vault (single source of truth):
    - A structured folder/DB for: pleadings, orders, exhibits, transcripts, emails, research memos, calendars.
    - Consistent naming: YYYY-MM-DD_[Court]_[DocType]_[ShortTopic]_[ECF#].pdf.
2. 
3. Local Authority Library:
    - Jurisdiction-filtered: statutes, rules, pattern jury instructions, and the top 50 controlling cases per claim/defense.
    - Keep official PDFs and note authoritative cites + pin cites.
4. 
5. Facts & Record Graph:
    - A living timeline (date, source, fact, exhibit cite, authentication).
    - Issue tags (e.g., “notice,” “material breach,” “exhaustion,” “harmless error”).
6. 
7. Judge/Opponent Profiles (ethical):
    - Prior rulings on your recurring motions, preferred authorities, tolerance for sanctions, page-limit quirks.
    - Opponent patterns: delays, boilerplate, favored defenses, evidentiary tells.
8. 
9. Deadline Engine:
    - Auto-calc rules (service, response, reply, disclosures, MSJ, Daubert).
    - Red/amber/green lead times (e.g., D-21 research, D-14 outline, D-7 draft, D-2 cites check, D-1 file).
10. 

# **Research: turning “search” into controlled retrieval**

Goal: Find what’s controlling, extract the rule, and document provenance so nothing “AI-ish” leaks into your citations.

1. Query like a litigator, not a tourist
    - Start with elements of the claim/defense, then dispositive standards (TRO/MSJ/12(b)(6)), then remedies.
    - Use conjunctive prompts: “Find controlling 9th Cir. authority (post-2015) on compelled arbitration waiver when delay + prejudice; provide pin cites.”
2. 
3. Parallel source triangulation
    - Pull from at least two primary databases + the official reporter PDF.
    - Cross-read headnotes against the actual opinion text; headnotes are not law.
4. 
5. Shepardize/KeyCite before you fall in love
    - Note treatment with a traffic-light tag in your memo (Green = followed; Yellow = distinguished; Red = negative).
6. 
7. Authority Matrix (keep this evergreen)
    - Columns: Issue ▸ Case ▸ Court/Year ▸ Rule (one sentence) ▸ Pin Cite ▸ How Used (support/limit) ▸ Status.
    - This becomes your cite farm for every brief.
8. 

Prompt you can paste:

“Identify the controlling authorities (Supreme Court, [Circuit], [State high court]) on [issue]. Output as a table with: rule in one sentence, the precise pin cite, posture, and how courts treat it. Exclude persuasive cases unless no controlling law exists. Flag any abrogation.”

# **Case-Law Analysis: from opinions to arguments**

Deliverables to generate with AI (and keep):

- Holding Cards: For each key case: posture, material facts, holding, rule, limits, best quote (≤25 words), and the exact page.
- Analogize/Distinguish Grid: Row = your fact; Col A = Friendly case similarity; Col B = Opposing case difference; Col C = Why the difference matters legally.
- Burden Map: Who carries what burden at each stage; what evidence satisfies it; where the opponent is thin.

Prompt:

“From the attached PDF opinions, extract: (1) rule statement; (2) holding; (3) material facts; (4) limits; (5) exact pin cite. Then produce an ‘Analogize/Distinguish’ grid against these case facts: [your facts].”

# **Procedural Strategy: playing the docket like a board**

Opening Book (first 30–45 days):

- Lock a Procedural Calendar; list all known deadlines + likely motion windows.
- File an early record-cleaner (motion to compel specifics, protective order scope, or a short status report) to frame the battlefield.
- Send targeted RFAs designed to freeze key elements (jurisdiction, authenticity, business records, notice).

Middlegame (pressure & traps):

- War-Game Trees: “If they move for MSJ on causation, our 3 counters are A/B/C; evidence nodes X/Y/Z; cases Q/R/S.”
- Trap Filings: Narrow 30(b)(6) topics, date-limited RFPs, or a motion in limine roadmap that makes their later position contradictory.
- Narrative Control: Short, judge-friendly statements of issue framing in every filing; always include a 1-page issues chart.

Endgame (pre-trial to verdict):

- In limine suite sequenced to exclude their keystone and admit your anchors.
- Jury-Instruction Back-solve: Draft the instruction first; make every evidence fight serve that language.
- Verdict-Form Engineering: Element-by-element questions matching your proof grid.

Prompts:

- “Build a game tree from today’s docket. List the opponent’s likely three next moves, our counters, what proof each needs, and the strongest authority for each node.”
- “Draft a 1-page issues chart for [motion] with: element, our proof, their likely rebuttal, our reply, and cites.”

# **Implementing “Docket = Chessboard”**

1. Live Docket Log
    - Columns: ECF#, Title, Who, Rule/Authority, Relief Sought, Status, Next Deadline, Our Action, Risk (H/M/L).
    - AI can summarize each new filing into the log and highlight new risks.
2. 
3. Move Review (per filing)
    - AI extracts: concessions, inconsistent statements, new exhibits, and admissibility problems (foundation, hearsay, 403).
    - Output: a “Counter-Move Brieflet” (≤400 words) you can drop into your draft.
4. 
5. Judge Preference Overlay
    - For each motion type, the model pulls your judge’s prior orders and surfaces preferred frameworks and pet peeves.
6. 
7. Clock Control
    - Generate a “No-Surprise Calendar”: D-21 outline, D-14 first draft, D-10 red team, D-7 cite check, D-3 exhibits final, D-1 QC.
8. 

# **Quality Gates (how you prevent AI errors)**

- Source-only drafting: Quotes only from the attached PDF with a pin cite next to the quote.
- Cite-first drafting: Paste your Authority Matrix into the prompt; tell the model “Use only these sources; do not invent citations.”
- Red-Team Pass: After you draft, run: “You are opposing counsel. Attack this on: jurisdiction, ripeness, waiver, evidentiary foundations, remedy. Provide page-line hits.”
- Judge-View Pass: “Rewrite the intro to match this judge’s preferred structure: issue ▸ rule ▸ application ▸ relief (≤250 words).”

# **Templates to reuse (condensed)**

Issue Synthesis Block (drop into any brief):

- Issue: …
- Rule (controlling): [one sentence + pin cite]
- Application: [2–4 bullets keyed to exhibits/pin cites]
- Relief: [exact order requested]

Fact-Proof Table:

Issue Synthesis Block (drop into any brief):

- Issue: …
- Rule (controlling): [one sentence + pin cite]
- Application: [2–4 bullets keyed to exhibits/pin cites]
- Relief: [exact order requested]

Fact-Proof Table:

| **Element** | **Fact** | **Exhibit/Â¶** | **Foundation** | **Case/Rule** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

RFA Trap (surgical):

# Admit that Exhibit 14 is a true and correct copy of the email dated [date] sent by [name] to [name], kept in the ordinary course of business.

Opposition Skeleton (12(b)(6)/MSJ):

- Roadmap paragraph.
- Short facts (record cites only).
- Standard (controlling authority; no treatise).
- Argument headings = elements.
- Each heading ends with a mini-holding: “Thus, element 2 is met as a matter of law.”

# **Collaboration & ethics guardrails**

- Confidentiality: Keep privileged docs local. Don’t paste sensitive client names into third-party tools unless covered by your confidentiality framework.
- Attribution: Clearly mark which sections are AI-assisted and re-verify all quotes/cites.
- No UPL: AI is a drafting and analysis tool. Final legal judgment is yours.

# **Quick start: 90-minute sprint (copy this checklist)**

1. Load the last 5 docket entries and your top 10 exhibits.
2. Ask: “Summarize changes to risk posture and new deadlines from ECF ##–##.”
3. Build/refresh the Authority Matrix for the next motion you expect.
4. Generate the Analogize/Distinguish Grid against your 3 best and 3 worst cases.
5. Produce a 1-page issues chart and a 400-word brieflet you can paste into your draft.
6. Run the Red-Team Pass.
7. Book the next two counter-moves and assign document owners/due dates.
