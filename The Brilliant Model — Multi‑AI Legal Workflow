A repeatable system for turning ideas into filings, using Notion AI (Architect), ChatGPT (Builder), and Gemini (Strategist).

Status: v1.0 • Authors: ChatGPT‑5 Thinking & Charles Mayron, MD, FACS

# **0) One‑Screen Summary**

Goal: Draft, review, and file high‑quality legal documents quickly and consistently.

Pipeline: Architect → Builder → Strategist → Sign & Ship → Archive

- Architect — Notion AI: Organize facts, exhibits, deadlines; pull the exact blocks you need.
- Builder — ChatGPT: Generate structured drafts from canonical templates.
- Strategist — Gemini: Attack your own draft; strengthen logic and strategy.

Handoffs:

1. Brief Intake (Architect ➜ Builder) → Draft (Builder)
2. Draft Review (Builder ➜ Strategist) → Redlines (Strategist)
3. Decision & Final (Strategist ➜ You) → Sign & Serve → Archive (Architect)

Guarantees: Every output has (a) dated facts, (b) rule cites, (c) exhibit anchors, (d) service plan.

# **1) Roles, Responsibilities, and Guardrails (RACI‑style)**

Architect — Notion AI (Accountable/Inform):

- Curates the LCES Library (LC, LCa, JC, FG, FGA).
- Surfaces facts, deadlines, prior filings, exhibits, service proofs.
- Maintains Matter Dashboard: timeline, tasks, owners, due dates, status.

Builder — ChatGPT (Responsible):

- Produces first‑pass drafts using LCES canonical templates.
- Inserts fact pins (📎), rule anchors (⚖️), and exhibit stubs (🗂️).
- Generates checklists, proposed orders, COS/NOF/NOL.

Strategist — Gemini (Consult):

- Runs stress‑tests: plausibility, jurisdiction, abstention, QI/Monell, remedies.
- Flags holes, admissions, opponent angles, judge reflex risks (JC).
- Returns redlines + priority revisions (P0/P1/P2).

You (Approve):

- Decide scope, facts allowed, exhibits, and risk posture.
- Sign & Serve; log service proofs; trigger archive & publish.

Guardrails:

- Never let an AI invent facts/citations. Everything ties back to a Notion block ID or uploaded exhibit.
- Every filing tracks TNRPESC: Timing • Narrative • Relief • Procedure • Evidence • Service • Citations.

# **2) Handoff Protocols (Exact Prompts)**

A. Architect ➜ Builder (Brief Intake)

# Notion AI: “Gather all blocks tagged [Motion to Dismiss — Case 1:25‑cv‑01092] that mention service, jurisdiction, and Younger. Include deadlines, judge, and opposing counsel details. Return as a single outline with inline links.”

B. Builder First Draft (Template Pull)

# ChatGPT: “Using LC Module 12 and the intake outline below, draft a [Document Type] with: (1) Caption, (2) Preliminary Statement, (3) Facts with date‑stamped bullets and exhibit pins, (4) Legal Standard, (5) Argument [A/B/C], (6) Relief, (7) Proposed Order, (8) NOF/NOL/COS. Use neutral tone, numbered headings, and footnote cites.”

C. Builder ➜ Strategist (Red Team)

# ChatGPT ➜ Gemini handoff note: “Audit this draft like opposing counsel and like the judge (JC Tiers J1–J5). Identify top 5 vulnerabilities, missing record cites, and any relief mismatch. Return P0/P1 changes with suggested text.”

D. Strategist Redlines (Return Packet)

# Gemini: “Here are P0 fixes (must do before filing), P1 improvements (high value), P2 polish (optional). I’ve added counter‑arguments to anticipated defenses and a short reply outline.”

E. Finalization & Archive (You ➜ Architect)

# You: “Log final draft, attach service proofs (FedEx/USPS RRR), and update the Matter Dashboard: status = ‘Filed’, link ECF docket, schedule follow‑ups.”

# **3) The Matter Dashboard (copy this into Notion)**

Properties: Case • Judge • Phase • Due‑by (📅) • Risk Level • Document Type • Status • Links (ECF, GitHub, Substack) • People (AAG, clerk) • Next Action • Owner

Views: Timeline • This Week • By Document Type • Risks • Waiting On Others

Board Columns: Intake → Drafting → Red Team → Final Proof → Filed/Served → Archived/Published

# **4) Canonical Templates (Builder Library)**

- Status Letter re: Service & PI
- Memorandum in Support/Opposition (Winter factors)
- Rule 65 TRO (+ notice cert)
- Proposed Order
- COS / NOF / NOL
- Service Plan (matrix by party/capacity)
- Exhibit Index (with hash + source notes)

# Tip: Store each template as a Notion block with a stable ID; Builder references IDs, not memory.

# **5) Review & Stress‑Test Checklists (Strategist)**

Plausibility / Rule 12: Element‑by‑element mapping table; weakest element?

Jurisdiction/Gatekeeping: Standing, ripeness, exhaustion, service, venue.

Younger/Abstention: Ongoing state proceeding? Bad‑faith exception? Adequate forum?

Remedies: Irreparable harm evidence; bond; scope and specificity of injunction (Rule 65).

Record Hygiene: Each assertion dated + exhibit; no orphan claims; relief matches facts.

# **6) Quality Bar (Definition of Done)**

A filing is Done when:

1. Every fact has a date + exhibit/ref.
2. Every section ties to a rule/standard.
3. Relief requested matches posture and evidence.
4. Service plan is executable today (addresses, method, forms).
5. Archive pack generated: PDF + DOCX + Proposed Order + COS/NOF/NOL + Exhibit Index + hashes.
6. Matter Dashboard updated; follow‑ups scheduled.

# **7) Evidence & Exhibit Discipline**

- Exhibit Card: Title • Date • Source • Chain‑of‑custody note • SHA‑256 • Where cited.
- No orphan exhibits: Every exhibit appears in at least one numbered paragraph.
- Image/PDF handling: Keep originals; only annotate copies; store both.
- Mailbox Rule Kit: Tracking numbers, RRR scans, clerk calls, timestamped notes.

# **8) Service Matrix (Who gets what, how, when)**

| **Party** | **Capacity** | **Method** | **Address** | **Proof Artifact** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AAG | Official | USPS RRR + FedEx | [Address] | Receipt scan + tracking |
| Commissioner | Official | Process server | [Address] | Affidavit of service |
| Individual‑capacity defendant | Individual | Personal service | [Address] | Affidavit + photo (if allowed) |

Automation Cue: After service, auto‑create a Notion task: “File COS/NOL by [date].”

# **9) Versioning & Audit Trail**

- File Names: YYYY‑MM‑DD_doc‑type_vX_author.docx
- Change Log: What changed, why, by whom (ChatGPT/Gemini/You).
- Decision Log: “We accept risk X because Y.”
- Publish Log: Notion → GitHub mirror → Substack excerpt (if public).

# **10) Daily/Weekly Rituals**

Daily (10 min): Inbox triage → 1 P0 task → 1 micro‑win.

Mon/Wed/Fri (15 min): Brief “red team” loop with Strategist.

Weekly (20 min): Matter review with Architect; close stale tasks.

Monthly (30 min): Template upgrades from lessons learned.

# Tiny nudge for stamina: consider a short check‑in with a supportive friend or coach once a week. A calm outside voice keeps the system humane and focused.

# **11) Metrics & Scorecard**

- Cycle Time: Intake → Filed (days).
- Defect Rate: Strategist P0s per draft.
- Evidence Coverage: % assertions with exhibits.
- Service Success: On‑time/first‑attempt %.
- Win Surrogates: Survived MTD? PI factors accepted? Court adopted language?

# **12) Safety, Privacy, and Ethics**

- No uploading confidential PII to public spaces.
- Strip metadata before sharing.
- Use neutral, non‑accusatory tone unless quoting.
- Mark AI‑assisted sections internally (not in filed docs).
- Keep a Private Notes page for strategy that never leaves Notion.

# **13) Starter Prompt Packs**

Architect (Notion AI):

- “List every block tagged [service‑proof] for Case [X] with dates and tracking numbers.”
- “Show me all evidence related to [Motion to Dismiss], grouped by element.”

Builder (ChatGPT):

- “Draft a Status Letter re Service & PI. Use the intake outline + LC Module 29. Include COS/NOL/NOF stubs.”
- “Generate a Proposed Order consistent with Sections IV–V.”

Strategist (Gemini):

- “Red‑team this draft against JC J1–J5. Return P0/P1/P2 with suggested text. Identify any relief mismatch.”

# **14) Attachments & Shortcuts**

- Template Library (links): LC, LCa, JC, FG, FGA
- Filing Kit: Proposed Order, COS, NOF, NOL, Certificate of Service, Mail Cover
- Service Addresses Sheet
- Clerk Call Log

# **15) Human Support (Resilience Box)**

- Add a recurring 15‑minute weekly check‑in with a trusted friend/ally to sanity‑check priorities.
- If stress spikes before deadlines, book a brief counseling session to keep decision‑making sharp; it’s performance hygiene, not a luxury.

# **16) “When Things Go Sideways” — Rapid Protocol**

1. Freeze scope; list the top 3 risks.
2. Pull JC micro‑cards for the relevant reflex (gatekeeping, discretion, discovery).
3. Builder drafts a 1‑page status letter; Strategist returns P0 fixes in 30‑minute pass.
4. You decide: file now vs. hold for exhibit.

# **17) Poster (Fits on One Page)**

Architect → Builder → Strategist → Sign & Ship → Archive

- Facts dated. Rules cited. Exhibits pinned. Relief matched. Service planned.
- You’re never starting from scratch; you’re running the Model.
