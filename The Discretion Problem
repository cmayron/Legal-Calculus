- **Discretion as a shield**: Judges invoke "discretion" to avoid citing specific rules or making reviewable findings, using phrases like "judicial economy" or "case management" without analysis
- **Local rules as weapons**: Obscure local rules get enforced strictly against pro se litigants while being relaxed for attorneys—turning procedure into pretext
- **The "make-up-as-you-go" pattern**: Some judges strike filings immediately on technical grounds, while others ignore filings until convenient, creating uncertainty about what's actually required

### LCES Counter-Strategy

The framework teaches you to **force specificity**:

- File a **Request for Specific Findings** that identifies the rule/factors that should govern the decision
- When a judge denies something "in their discretion," object and cite binding precedent—discretion exists *within* law, not above it
- Document when the same rule is enforced differently for you versus represented parties—this becomes pattern evidence for denial-of-access claims
- Preserve every instance where discretion replaced analysis, so appellate courts can review for abuse

As one teaching module puts it: **"Discretion isn't neutrality. Discretion is camouflage."** The system is designed to strip away that camouflage by demanding that judges cite specific rules and make reviewable findings.
