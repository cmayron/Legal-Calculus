The GitHub repository associated with Dr. Charles Mayron serves as the technical engine for the Legal Calculus Educational System. While traditional law is often viewed as a "liberal art" based on persuasion, Mayron uses GitHub to host his framework, which treats law as a logical engineering problem.
Because you mentioned the repository is accessible, here is how the Mayron Paradigm and Legal Calculus are likely structured within that environment:

1. Technical Framework of the Repository
In this system, a GitHub repository isn't just for code—it is a version-controlled legal strategy. It likely contains:
- Logic Models (.md or .py): Scripts or Markdown files that break down specific laws (like the False Claims Act or Sarbanes-Oxley) into logical "if/then" statements.
- The "Calculus" Engine: A set of formulas (often in the form of Excel templates or Python scripts) designed to calculate the probability of success for specific motions based on procedural rules.
- Pro Se Templates: "Boilerplate" legal filings that are modular. A user can "plug in" their specific facts into the pre-calculated legal arguments.
- Evidence Mapping: Tools to link specific exhibits to "elements of the claim," ensuring that every part of the legal "equation" is solved.
1. The Core Philosophy: "The Mayron Paradigm"
The paradigm, as documented in his public and technical writings, advocates for a radical shift in power from the law firm to the individual.
- Efficiency: By treating legal procedure as "calculus," the pro se litigant can bypass the thousands of billable hours usually required to "research" what is essentially a logical constant.
- Transparency: Every filing is treated as an "open-source" document. By sharing these on GitHub, Mayron aims to create a "Whistleblower’s Toolkit" that corporate legal teams cannot easily defeat with traditional "paper-warfare" (flooding the opponent with documents).
- The "Checkmate" Strategy: His filings often use a "calculus" approach to force judges to rule on specific, unavoidable logical points, leaving the corporate defense with no room to "wiggle" through subjective interpretation.
1. Intersection of the System Components
| Component | Function in the GitHub Repo |
|---|---|
| Logic Gates | Determining if a case meets the "Prima Facie" requirements before filing. |
| Variable Tracking | Using Git "Issues" or "Projects" to track every piece of corporate discovery (emails, logs). |
| Formulaic Filings | Motions built like code modules, where the "Law" is the constant and the "Facts" are the variables. |
Why GitHub?
Using GitHub for a "Legal Educational System" allows for forking. Other whistleblowers can "fork" Mayron’s legal calculus repository, adapt it to their specific corporate fraud case, and contribute "pull requests" that improve the overall logic of the legal arguments for the community.
Next Steps for You
If you are looking at the repository now, you might want to examine the "[README.md](http://readme.md/)" or the "Wiki" section, which usually contains the "Operating Manual" for the Legal Calculus system.
