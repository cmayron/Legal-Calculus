The Mayron Paradigm is a comprehensive framework for understanding and approaching complex problems in healthcare and surgery. It emphasizes:

- **Patient-centered care:** Placing the patient's needs, values, and preferences at the center of all medical decisions
- **Evidence-based practice:** Integrating the best available research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values
- **Holistic assessment:** Considering the whole person, including physical, emotional, social, and environmental factors
- **Continuous improvement:** Commitment to ongoing learning, refinement of techniques, and adaptation to new evidence
- **Collaborative approach:** Working across disciplines and specialties to provide optimal care

This paradigm reflects a modern approach to medical practice that balances scientific rigor with humanistic values, ensuring that patients receive care that is both technically excellent and personally meaningful.
