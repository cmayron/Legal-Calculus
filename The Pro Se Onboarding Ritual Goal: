Part 1 | Module 0: The Pro Se Onboarding Ritual
Goal: To stabilize the case and protect your rights in the "Blackout Period" (the first 72–168 hours after losing representation).

1. The Document Audit (The "Source Code" Check)
Before you file anything, you must know what the court thinks is happening.
- The Docket Scan: Download the complete docket. Identify the very next deadline.
- The "Substitution of Counsel": Ensure the court has your current contact information. If you don't receive the mail, you lose by default.
1. The "Motion for Extension of Time" (Buying Breath)
Courts generally grant a one-time "grace period" when an attorney withdraws.
- The Script: "Pro Se Litigant [Your Name] respectfully requests a 30-day stay or extension to secure new counsel or familiarize themselves with the procedural posture of the case."
- The Ritual: This isn't just a filing; it's your first act of sovereignty. You are telling the court: I am here, and I am paying attention.
1. The Emotional Firewall
- The Rule of 24: Never respond to opposing counsel’s emails in under 24 hours. They will use your lack of representation to bait you into emotional, legally damaging admissions.
🛠 Part 2 | The Mistake-to-Module Template
This is the tool you will use to turn every "loss" into a "lesson" for the People’s Law School. We treat a legal error like a software bug.
| Field | Description | Your Input (Example) |
|---|---|---|
| The "Bug" | What specific procedural or substantive error occurred? | I filed an affidavit, but the judge ruled it "inadmissible hearsay." |
| The "Why" | What rule was cited? Why did the system reject it? | Rule 801: I tried to testify about what a witness told me instead of getting their statement. |
| The "Patch" | How do we fix this for the next person? | Use a "Declaration under Penalty of Perjury" from the actual witness, or find a Hearsay Exception (Rule 803). |
| The "Ritual" | A mnemonic or habit to prevent this. | The "Source Check": Before filing any fact, ask: "Did I see this myself, or did I hear it?" |
🧬 Part 3 | The Empowerment Formula
In the People’s Law School, we use a simple logic to determine our next move:
Action = (Rule + Fact) \times Admissibility
- Rule: What does the law say?
- Fact: What actually happened?
- Admissibility: Can the judge legally "see" it?
If any of these is zero, your Action equals zero. Our curriculum focuses on making sure no variable is left blank.
