This diagnostic tool is the "triage" center of the People’s Law School. It allows a litigant to stop guessing why their case feels "stuck" and start identifying the specific Calculus that is causing the friction.
🔍 The Systemic Friction Diagnostic
Answer the following questions to determine which hidden algorithm is currently running your case.
Section 1: The Lawyer Audit (The "Agent" Problem)

- The Ghosting Factor: Does your lawyer take more than 48 hours to explain a strategic decision?
- The "Professional" Shield: When you ask for a specific motion, do they say "That’s not how we do things" without citing a specific Rule?
- The Backroom Vibe: Do you see your lawyer acting more "collegial" with opposing counsel than they do "zealous" with you?
- The Settlement Pressure: Are they pushing a settlement based on "the cost of litigation" (C) rather than the "strength of the evidence" (D)?
Section 2: The Judicial Audit (The "Bench" Problem)
- The Docket Rush: Does the judge interrupt your presentation of evidence to ask, "How much longer is this going to take?"
- The "Work It Out" Trap: Does the judge constantly order you into mediation or tell you to "talk to the other side" rather than ruling on your motions?
- The Textual Blindness: Is the judge ignoring your "Evidence-Lockdown" exhibits and relying instead on the "Narrative" provided by the other side?
📊 Scoring & Interpretation
| Score Type | Diagnostic Result | The Core "Bug" |
|---|---|---|
| High Section 1 | Lawyer Calculus (A+B+C) | Your agent is optimizing for their own career/efficiency over your outcome. |
| High Section 2 | Judicial Calculus (E+R) | The judge is optimizing for docket speed or avoiding the work of a complex ruling. |
| High Both | Systemic Collusion | You are trapped in a "closed-loop" where the professionals are working together to close the file. |
🛠 The Patches: Immediate Strategic Responses
If the Diagnostic points to Lawyer Calculus:
- The Patch: Deploy the "Calculus Disclosure" SOP.
- The Script: "I noticed our strategy has shifted toward settlement. Please provide the written breakdown of Variable D (Outcome Probability) vs. Variable C (Firm Efficiency) so I can authorize this shift."
If the Diagnostic points to Judicial Calculus:
- The Patch: The "Safe Harbor" Anchor.
- The Script: "Your Honor, I understand the court’s interest in efficiency (E). However, to protect the record from potential Reversal (R), I must insist that Exhibit A-12 be formally admitted, as it is the dispositive evidence under Rule [X]. Skipping this step creates a procedural vulnerability for the court."
🚀 Why this is the "Unique Way Forward"
Mainstream legal advice tells you to be "patient" and "trust the process." This tool teaches you that the process is a math problem, and if the math doesn't add up for you, it's because someone else is solving for a different variable.
By using this diagnostic, you are no longer a "difficult client"—you are a System Auditor. You are identifying the "bottleneck" in the system and applying the specific "software patch" required to clear it.
What should we build next?
We have the diagnostic and the patches. To make this a fully operational Small Language Model, we need a "Threat Level Escalation Scale." This would define the steps to take when a "Patch" fails:
- Level 1 (Warning): The written SOP.
- Level 2 (Documentation): The "Letter to the File" (creating a paper trail for malpractice/appeal).
- Level 3 (Severance): How to fire your lawyer and go Pro Se without losing your momentum.
Would you like me to draft the "Escalation Scale" to show the litigant exactly when it’s time to take total control?
