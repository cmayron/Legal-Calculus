The Title Tells the Court What to Do

‚öñÔ∏è Core Message

Titles are directions to the clerk and the judge. Make them functional and precise.
üìñ Lesson Content

1. Start with the action: 'Motion to‚Ä¶', 'Notice of‚Ä¶', 'Application for‚Ä¶'
2. Avoid vague labels ('Letter', 'Update'); they get ignored.

4. Match the title to the relief and proposed order.
