AI can generate strong legal arguments fast. But courts don’t accept “good arguments” in the abstract — they accept properly structured filings.

A common error is relying on a single AI draft and assuming:

- the argument is the best available version, and
- the document is fileable as written.

In practice, AI drafts often fail for procedural reasons even when the substance is strong:

- incorrect caption / parties / judge line
- missing rule posture (“what is this filing?”)
- missing Certificate of Service (or wrong service method)
- missing signature block, address block, date, or verification
- missing required attachments/exhibits or exhibit labeling
- wrong terminology (e.g., “affirmation” vs “affidavit” depending on the court)

Legal Calculus rule: Every AI draft must pass a Fileability Checklist before it ever touches the docket.

**The LCES Workflow Standard (AI-to-AI)**

1. Draft AI: generate substance
2. Structure AI: convert into court format (caption, rule posture, relief, COS)
3. Red-Team AI: attempt to break it (service timing, rule compliance, missing components)
4. Final pass: “Would a clerk accept this today?”

This is how you turn AI into a practical tool rather than a procedural liability.
