You’re right—the separation you’ve built (Architect → Builder → Strategist) is a solid, defensible UPL-mitigation pattern. It keeps the “Builder” out of a conversational role, constrains it to document assembly from structured inputs, and leaves any interpretation to the user/Strategist. Below is a crisp, drop-in policy pack you can paste into Notion/TOS/runbooks.

# **UPL Safety Architecture (One-Pager)**

Purpose. Keep LCES in the “procedural compliance & document preparation” lane; avoid individualized legal advice.

Roles.

- Architect (Notion AI): collects facts via forms; emits a Blueprint JSON (no questions answered; no advice).
- Builder (ChatGPT): not user-facing; transforms Blueprint → formatted documents/templates; no analysis, no suggestions.
- Strategist (User/Gemini): reviews for completeness/consistency; does not ask Builder questions; may revise facts/choices in Architect.

Core Controls.

1. No chat surface to Builder. Builder only receives machine-readable Blueprint; returns artifacts (DOCX/PDF/MD).
2. Hard prompts: Builder is “document assembler only;” refuses advice/strategy and flags any “analysis” tokens.
3. Banned intents (detectors): “best argument”, “likelihood of success”, “what should I do”, “how to win”, etc. If detected anywhere (including facts), route to a UPL banner + stop.
4. Scope limiter: output = forms, checklists, captions, certificates of service, tables of contents, exhibit stamps, cover sheets, calendaring stubs.
Not allowed = legal conclusions, strategic comparisons, forum selection advice, damages calculations beyond user-entered numbers.
5. Attestations: Before generation, the user confirms: “I am not receiving legal advice. I will consult a lawyer for legal questions.”
6. Jurisdictional disclaimers: Dynamic banner noting variation by state; link to lawyer-referral resources.
7. Audit log: preserve Blueprint, Builder prompt hash, artifact checksum, and UPL scan results.

Incident Response.

- If any banned intent is hit → block, log, show banner, offer lawyer referral + generic education.
- Track incidents; update banned-phrase list and tests.

You are a non-interactive DOCUMENT ASSEMBLER. You receive a Blueprint JSON.
DO NOT provide legal advice, analysis, or suggestions.
DO NOT chat, ask questions, or reason about strategy.
Only: validate fields syntactically; render documents (captions, headings, numbered paragraphs, certificates of service, exhibit indices) using the Blueprint as-is.
If any content implies advice (e.g., “best argument”, “likelihood of success”, “what should I do”), STOP and return:
{"status":"blocked_upl","reason":"UPL risk phrase detected"}
Return artifacts plus a machine-readable manifest with checksums.

# **Strategist Review Rubric (for your checklist)**

- Completeness: All required sections present (caption, parties, jurisdiction statement, facts, counts, prayer, signature, service).
- Consistency: Names, dates, exhibit IDs match across body, index, and footers.
- Procedural Fit: Correct court name, page limits, signature block, certificates.
- No Advice Leakage: Document contains zero outcome predictions or recommendations.
- Traceability: Manifest + checksums logged; Blueprint archived.

# **UI Copy (Notion + banners)**

- Top Banner: “LCES provides document preparation and procedural formatting only. We do not provide legal advice. Laws vary by state. Consider speaking with a licensed attorney.”
- CTA (neutral): “Find lawyer referrals → [state bar link placeholder]” and “General self-help resources → [court help center link].”
- Pre-Generate Attestation (checkbox): “I understand LCES is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice.”

# **Banned-Intent Detector (seed list)**

“best argument”, “how do I win”, “likelihood of success”, “is this claim valid”, “which court should I choose”, “what should I argue”, “should I settle”, “how much is my case worth”, “is this malpractice”, “is this defamation”.

# **Logging Manifest (per run)**

run_id, timestamp, blueprint_sha256, builder_prompt_sha256, output_sha256, upl_scan=pass|block, jurisdiction_tag, user_attestation=true|false

**Test Scenarios (pass/fail)**

- PASS: “Assemble AZ complaint with these facts and exhibits.” → Generates formatted pleading only.
- BLOCK: Fact text includes “what’s my best argument?” → Returns blocked_upl with banner + resources.
- PASS: “Add certificate of service USPS RRR and exhibit footers.” → Procedural formatting only.
- BLOCK: “Pick the two strongest counts.” → Blocked.
