**LCES is an educational system — not legal advice.**
It is designed to help you understand procedural structure, not to replace a lawyer or official guidance.

**You are solely responsible for understanding and following the rules, deadlines, and filing requirements in your own jurisdiction.**

## Always verify:

- ✅ The current local rules and administrative orders
- 🗓️ Deadlines and filing schedules
- 🧾 Forms, fees, and service methods
- 🏛️ The correct court or agency for your filing

**LCES provides structure — you provide compliance.**

When in doubt, check with a local legal aid clinic, court self-help center, or licensed attorney in your area.
