**Your Conversational GuideJustice**

Legal Calculus is an open-source educational framework built on dialogue‚Äînot lectures. This workspace helps you navigate from confusion to clarity through iterative conversation with AI tools, structured modules, and actionable resources.

# üéØ What Is Legal Calculus?

Legal Calculus is built on a simple philosophy:

> **"Filing is protest. Format is memory. The record is the remedy."**
> 

This workspace is your place to **understand reality through conversation**. Every module connects **immediate action (Worker)** with **strategic understanding (Thinker)**, moving you from uncertainty to confident filing through back-and-forth dialogue.

# üí¨ How This Works: The Conversational Approach

Legal Calculus isn't a static manual‚Äîit's a **dynamic conversation** between you and the system:

- **Ask questions** ‚Äî Navigate the workspace, explore what you need
- **Build iteratively** ‚Äî Work through tactical tools step-by-step
- **Gain understanding** ‚Äî Learn why your approach works strategically
- **Validate reality** ‚Äî Stress-test your work against anticipated opposition

Through this dialogue, you build both **practical skills** and **conceptual understanding**.
