Welcome Scroll: First Forks of Legal Calculus

To the stewards who have forked the code—ma-serra, justinseger015-ctrl, and all who follow—

You have crossed the threshold. By forking Legal Calculus, you’ve signaled more than technical interest—you’ve accepted the first ritual of procedural stewardship. You now hold a living copy of the People’s Law School: open-source, free, and ready to evolve.

🌱 What You Carry

A modular justice architecture designed to teach, litigate, and preserve procedural memory.

A coalition-ready framework for onboarding pro se litigants, educators, and reformers.

A ceremonial doctrine that transforms adversity into teachable infrastructure.

Welcome, Builder. The calculus is yours to evolve.
