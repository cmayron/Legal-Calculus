**Discretion Gap**

**—and how to close it**

By ChatGPT (first author) & Charles Mayron, MD, FACS

TL;DR: If you give the same facts and the same rules to the same machine, you get the same answer. That’s how Legal Calculus (LC) works: it computes the rule-pure outcome. Courts don’t. Judicial discretion turns identical inputs into different outputs—sometimes into outright injustice. We can measure that variance, expose it, and shrink it.

Courts like to say they apply the law. What they apply, too often, is themselves.

Anyone who has filed pro se learns this the hard way. You can structure a motion perfectly, cite controlling authority, attach exhibits, and still be told there is “nothing to rule.” Or you can ask for three weeks to protect an appeal of right and be accused of “attacking the state courts.” The facts haven’t changed. The rules haven’t changed. What changed is discretion.

We call the distance between what the law computes and what the forum does the Discretion Gap (DG). And the DG is where justice goes to die.

# **The computational baseline**

Legal Calculus/Field Guide (LC/FG) is deliberately boring in the best way. Give it F (facts) and R (rules), and it computes Y*—the outcome a court should reach if it followed the law consistently. You don’t need a robe to get there:

- Four TRO factors? Winter.
- §1983 anti-injunction exception? Mitchum v. Foster.
- Prospective relief against state officials? Ex parte Young.
- Arbitration remedies where the contract is silent? Mastrobuono (punitive damages are still on the table).

When you encode Y* into a clean Proposed Order, attach evidence with pinpoints, and file a searchable PDF, you’ve created a reproducible, auditable computation of the law.

That’s what LC/FG provides: determinism.

# **Where outcomes drift**

Then comes LCa/JC—the practitioner and judicial layers where drift happens. Here discretion becomes variance:

- Strike vs. Silence: filings erased on sight or ignored until consolidation.
- Conflation: a narrow request for time is reframed as an impermissible attack on courts.
- Erasure: Mitchum disappears, and suddenly “federal courts have no place in state matters.”
- Performance hearings: the decision is written before you speak.

Same inputs. Different outputs. That’s the Discretion Gap.

We can pretend this is “judicial craft.” Or we can call it what it is: inconsistency that the law neither requires nor tolerates.

# **Make the gap visible**

Here is the simplest reform you’ve never heard of: log the DG.

1. Compute Y* (the rule-pure outcome) using LC modules.
2. Encode Y* in a one-page Proposed Order.
3. File with pinpoints and a validated TOA (email it to yourself for a time-stamped diligence record).
4. Capture Y—the actual ruling (quote it).
5. Log the variance: what LC computed vs what the judge did; the doctrine invoked to justify drift; the module tags that identify the tactic (Strike, Conflation, Hearing ≠ Decision).

Do this across a docket and the pattern becomes undeniable. The court can call you vexatious; the data will call it inconsistent.

# **A short list of honest fixes**

You don’t need a constitutional convention to shrink the Discretion Gap. You need plumbing.

- Proposed-Order discipline: courts should refuse to strike “for notice only” when a clean order is attached. If there’s something to rule, rule it.
- Pro se parity: allow e-filing for self-represented parties; stop weaponizing bank checks and postal delay against TROs.
- Mailbox fairness: if an order arrives by mail four days late, the deadline should extend four days. That’s not mercy—it’s math.
- Mitchum fidelity: federal judges should enforce the Supreme Court’s own carve-out. §1983 remains an exception to the Anti-Injunction Act.
- Arbitration clarity up front: require early orders confirming the scope of remedies. If the agreement doesn’t bar punitive damages, they’re on the table. Say it.
- Validation culture: every serious filing gets a TOA and a short validation note. Courts who fear “AI hallucinations” should reward diligence rather than punish access.
- DG transparency: publish a one-page DG Appendix with any appeal: Y* (the law) vs Y (the result) + the doctrine used to create the delta.

These are not radical demands. They are table stakes for a justice system that wants to be believed.

# **“But discretion is essential.”**

Yes—bounded discretion is essential. Unbounded discretion is simply power. The public can accept hard outcomes; it cannot accept coin flips. The judicial oath is not to preserve variability; it is to apply the law—especially when doing so is inconvenient.

If the same inputs produce different outputs because two judges prefer two different stories, the system isn’t neutral; it’s personal. That is how pro se litigants learn to distrust a courthouse that keeps changing the math.

# **The human cost of variance**

When a court ignores Mitchum, it is not merely missing a footnote. It is erasing the Supreme Court’s bridge to federal protection when state systems suppress rights. When a judge treats a request for “time to preserve appeal” as an “attack on state courts,” the discretion isn’t wise—it’s evasive. And when a clerk blocks e-filing but law firms file instantly, delay isn’t neutral—it’s targeted.

Variance is not theoretical. Variance is lost jobs, chilled speech, foreclosed appeals, and patients left unserved because a physician-whistleblower spent months fighting procedural sand.

# **What happens when justice becomes code**

Imagine both sides using structured tools—litigant and judge alike. The litigant computes Y* openly, offers a bounded order, and presents validated citations. The court either signs the order or explains, in elements, why Y* was not met.

- If Y = Y*, trust rises.
- If Y ≠ Y*, the DG is explicit and reviewable.

This isn’t replacing judges with machines. It’s inviting judges to act like the law is reproducible—to keep discretion where it belongs: at the margins, not at the center.

# **A closing note to courts**

You will be tempted to read this as a pro se manifesto. It isn’t. It is an invitation to accountability that protects everyone—judges included. When you decide inside the computation and explain variance outside it, you gain legitimacy. When you ignore the computation, you become the story.

Filing is protest. Format is memory. The record is the remedy.

The Discretion Gap tells us how healthy the remedy is.

Let’s make justice something we can compute—and
