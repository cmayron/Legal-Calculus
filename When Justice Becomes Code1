When Justice Becomes Code

Why courts should fear the Discretion Gap—and how to close it

By ChatGPT (first author) & Charles Mayron, MD, FACS

**TL;DR**

Give the same facts and the same rules to the same system and you should get the same result. Legal Calculus (LC) computes that rule-pure outcome. Courts don’t always match it—because discretion introduces variance. We call the distance between the lawful baseline and the real outcome the Discretion Gap (DG). You can measure it, expose it, and shrink it.

# **The quiet scandal of “same case, different judge”**

Anyone who files pro se learns this fast: perfect structure, controlling precedent, pinpointed exhibits—and a judge still says there’s “nothing to rule,” or reframes your narrow ask for time as an “attack on state courts.”

The facts haven’t changed. The rules haven’t changed. Discretion did.

That variance isn’t flavor; it’s inconsistency. And inconsistency is injustice in slow motion.

# **Law as computation, discretion as variance**

In Legal Calculus we treat law as a reproducible computation:

- Inputs: Facts F + Rules R
- LC/FG computes: Y* (the rule-pure outcome)
- Forum returns: Y (the decision) influenced by D (discretion)

Discretion Gap: DG = Y − Y*

- DG ≈ 0 → consistent, lawful application
- DG ≫ 0 → drift, denial, or evasion

Where each layer lives

- LC / FG (Field Guide): Deterministic baseline (modules, checklists, proposed-order templates)
- LCa (Lawyer Calculus): Practitioner controls to reduce DG (risk controls, TOA validation, record design)
- JC (Judicial Calculus): Pattern-mapping and naming of drift (strike/silence, conflation, hearing≠decision)

# **The baseline is boring—and that’s the point**

- TROs? Apply Winter factors.
- Federal intervention when state processes suppress rights? Mitchum v. Foster—§1983 is an exception to the Anti-Injunction Act.
- Prospective relief against state officials? Ex parte Young.
- Punitive damages in arbitration when the contract is silent? Mastrobuono—still on the table.

Encode that law-pure outcome (Y*) in a one-page Proposed Order, attach exhibits with pinpoints, validate your citations (TOA), export to PDF (locked), and file. That’s what LC/FG guarantees: reproducibility.

# **Where drift enters—and why it hurts**

JC documents the moves that push Y away from Y*:

- Strike vs. Silence — erase filings on sight or ignore until they’re moot
- Conflation — a narrow ask for time is framed as an attack on courts
- Erasure — Mitchum “disappears,” and suddenly there’s “no federal role”
- Performance hearings — the decision is prewritten; the hearing is theater

Variance is not academic; it is missed appeals, lost wages, chilled speech, and delayed care.

# **The DG Harness (use this in real cases)**

Make discretion visible and appealable with a five-step protocol:

1. Compute Y* with the LC module(s) (e.g., Winter, Mitchum).
2. Encode Y* in a Proposed Order (“IT IS ORDERED that…”).
3. Pinpoint Evidence: Exhibits with page/¶ cites; validated TOA (email to yourself for timestamped diligence).
4. Capture Y: Quote the operative ruling language.
5. Log DG:
    - Y* (your proposed order ¶)
    - Y (what the forum did)
    - Doctrine invoked (e.g., Rooker–Feldman, abstention, sovereign immunity)
    - Module tags (Conflation, Strike, Hearing≠Decision)
    - Delta (what changed and why)
6. 

Do this across your docket. Patterns materialize. So does the appeal.

# **Small reforms with big payoff**

You don’t need a revolution to shrink the DG—just plumbing:

- Proposed-Order discipline: If there’s something to sign, don’t strike “for notice only.”
- Pro se parity: Allow e-filing; stop weaponizing bank checks and postal delay against TROs.
- Mailbox fairness: If an order arrives four days after entry, extend the deadline four days.
- Mitchum fidelity: Federal courts should enforce the Supreme Court’s own carve-out.
- Arbitration clarity up front: Early order confirming scope of remedies (yes/no on punitives).
- Validation culture: TOA + second-system check; reward diligence instead of fearing “AI hallucinations.”
- DG transparency: One-page DG Appendix with any appeal: Y* vs. Y + doctrine used to produce the delta.

# **“But discretion is essential”**

Yes—bounded discretion is essential. Unbounded discretion is simply power.

The public will accept hard outcomes. It cannot accept coin flips. The oath is not to preserve variability; it is to apply the law—especially when doing so is inconvenient.

# **A note to judges (and to us)**

This isn’t a pro se manifesto. It’s an invitation to accountable consistency that protects everyone—judges included. Decide inside the computation and explain variance outside it. Do that and legitimacy grows. Ignore the computation and you become the story.

Filing is protest. Format is memory. The record is the remedy.

The Discretion Gap tells us how healthy that remedy is.

# **Call to action**

- Litigants: Run the DG harness in your next filing. Publish your DG log.
- Clinics/Educators: Teach LC for the baseline; use JC to name drift; measure DG in class.
- Courts: Adopt proposed-order discipline and mailbox fairness; confirm remedial scope early; publish data on variance.

When justice becomes code, we don’t lose humanity—we gain honesty. And honesty is how trust returns.
