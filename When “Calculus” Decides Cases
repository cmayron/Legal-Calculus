When “Calculus” Decides Cases

By a pro se litigant who refuses to disappear

There are three calculi in American courts:
	•	Judicial Calculus: keep the docket moving, avoid reversals, protect the institution.
	•	Lawyer Calculus: minimize risk and reputational cost, preserve relationships.
	•	Legal Calculus: apply law to facts and decide the merits.

In practice, the first two often beat the third—especially when you’re pro se.

Arizona, in one sentence

Statutes promise rights; Judicial Calculus funnels disputes to arbitration for everything, where records shrink and sunlight fades. Lawyer Calculus discourages strategies that might irritate a judge tomorrow. The merits barely get a word in today.

Why this keeps happening (no conspiracy required)
	•	Incentives: courts chase throughput; firms manage relationships.
	•	Asymmetry: pro se litigants are expected to trip on format and timing.
	•	Discretion: used to smooth caseloads, it can quietly bury uncomfortable claims.

Predictable outputs
	•	Returns without a rule citation.
	•	Reason-free orders—“in its discretion.”
	•	Compelled arbitration that privatizes public rights.
	•	Missing docket entries that erase effort after the fact.

A people’s counter-calculus (doable, repeatable)
	1.	Clocks, not vibes. Compute every deadline (service method + weekends/holidays). Ask for a short continuance before risk becomes default.
	2.	Proposed orders—every time. Numbered relief forces reason-giving; judges must cross lines out in public.
	3.	Reason-forcing motions. When orders lack findings or rule cites, move to clarify/amend so review is possible—or the absence is visible.
	4.	Docket mirrors. Save stamped PDFs and T+1 / T+expected screenshots. If it’s not visible, file a Notice of Filing & Request for Docketing and a Rule-Citation Request.
	5.	Archive bundles. Zip the filing, exhibits, screenshots, receipts, and a manifest with hashes. Shareable. Searchable. Appealable.

“But arbitration is faster”

At erasing patterns. If arbitration is unavoidable, create a public staging record first: the timeline, the order compelling arbitration, and the issues diverted from daylight. A sealed path may happen; a sealed history shouldn’t.

What AI is good for (and not)

AI won’t order relief. It will:
	•	Generate court-styled filings (caption tables, true numbered relief).
	•	Auto-insert certificates, Rule 65(b) notice certs, proposed orders.
	•	Compute deadlines and nag before risk becomes loss.
	•	Produce one-tap archive bundles (DOCX + PDF + screenshots + hashes).
	•	Draft rule-comments and amicus micro-packs from your data, not your mood.

AI isn’t a cure for injustice; it’s a price drop on persistence.

Four zero-budget reforms courts can adopt tomorrow
	1.	Mandatory rule citation on any return/rejection.
	2.	Required findings (facts + rule) for TRO/PI denials.
	3.	Receipt-to-docket transparency (median + current queue) on portals.
	4.	Pro se dashboards by part: time-to-docket, reasonless-order rate, return-without-rule rate.

To the bar and academy

If your calculus never risks relationships, you’ve confused professionalism with proximity to power. Teach legibility: make decisions explainable, records reviewable, and rules enforceable.

To pro se litigants

Write your goal at the top of every draft. File with proposed orders. When ignored, document the silence and escalate. Build your record as if you’re already writing the appellate brief—because you are.

We won’t out-argue discretion. We will out-record it.
