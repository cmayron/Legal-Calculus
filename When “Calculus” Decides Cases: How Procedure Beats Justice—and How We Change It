When “Calculus” Decides Cases: How Procedure Beats Justice—and How We Change It

By a pro se litigant who refuses to disappear

There are three “calculi” running American courts.
	•	Judicial Calculus: preserve docket flow, avoid reversible error, protect the institution.
	•	Lawyer Calculus: minimize risk and reputational cost, keep doors open with judges and opposing counsel, bill sustainably.
	•	Legal Calculus (what the public thinks courts do): apply law to facts and decide the merits.

In real life, the first two usually beat the third. And when you’re pro se, you’re the easiest mark.

Arizona, in one sentence

Arizona gives you statutory rights on paper. Judicial Calculus then routes the fight to arbitration for everything—including disputes that should stay in open court. What looks like “efficiency” is often erasure: a thin record, limited discovery, and outcomes sealed behind procedural doors. Meanwhile Lawyer Calculus quietly discourages strategies that might ruffle the judge you’ll be back in front of next month. The merits barely get a word in.

Discretion without guardrails becomes discrimination

We don’t need conspiracies to explain what’s happening. We need incentives.
	•	Courts are overwhelmed. Discretion helps move the docket.
	•	Law firms manage risk and relationships. Aggressive merits pushes can cost future clients.
	•	Pro se litigants are expected to fail procedural mazes on the first try.

The result is predictable:
	•	Returned filings without a rule citation.
	•	Reason-free orders—“in its discretion”—that cannot be meaningfully reviewed.
	•	Forced arbitration that converts public rights into private paperwork.
	•	Missing docket entries that retroactively void your effort because “it never happened.”

None of this is neutral. It rewards invisibility and punishes insistence on the merit.

Judicial Calculus vs. Legal Calculus

Legal Calculus is the promise: elements, burdens, evidence, controlling precedent.
Judicial Calculus is the practice: time, discretion, institutional interest.

The fastest way to reconcile them isn’t to plead for virtue; it’s to force legibility. You can’t demand justice from a black box. You can require reasons from it.

⸻

Lawyer Calculus vs. the client’s goal

Lawyers aren’t villains; they’re rational actors. But when your goal (stop retaliation, surface fraud, vindicate a statutory right) conflicts with their calculus (avoid conflicts, not become “that lawyer,” keep credibility with the bench), you will be told to trim the claim that makes the system uncomfortable. If you refuse, expect to stand alone—the pro se “easy mark.”

A people’s counter-calculus

Replacing hope with infrastructure is the only path forward. Here’s the seven-step counter-calculus that turns discretion into data—and data into leverage.
	1.	Clocks, not vibes.
Compute every deadline (service method + weekends/holidays). If you’re late, ask for a short continuance before default becomes the story.
	2.	Proposed orders—every time.
Judges should cross out numbered relief in public, not wave at “discretion” in the abstract. Numbered orders force reason-giving.
	3.	Reason-forcing motions.
When an order lacks findings or rule cites, move to clarify/amend. Make review possible—or make the absence visible.
	4.	Docket mirrors.
Treat the portal as evidence. Save stamped PDFs and T+1/T+expected screenshots. If the entry never appears, file a Notice of Filing & Request for Docketing and a Rule-Citation Request.
	5.	Archive bundles.
For each step, zip the filing, exhibits, screenshots, receipts, and a manifest with hashes. Shareable. Searchable. Appealable. Journalists and reform groups can use it; so can you on appeal.
	6.	Comparator logs.
Track similarly situated represented cases in the same court/part—motion type, timing, outcome. Discretion becomes measurable, and measurable is arguable.
	7.	Public comments & amicus micro-packs.
Use your log to request rule changes (e.g., mandatory rule citation for returns; required findings for TRO/PI denials), and to support others with five-page amicus briefs that show patterns, not vibes.

This isn’t a philosophical pivot. It’s a formatting one. Format makes memory. Memory pressures power.

“But arbitration is faster”

Yes—at erasing patterns. When statutory rights are shoved into private rooms, the public can’t learn and other litigants can’t build on your fight. If arbitration is unavoidable, create a public staging record first: the timeline, the order compelling arbitration, the issues that never saw daylight. A sealed path may be unavoidable; a sealed history is not.

AI won’t save us; it will scale us

AI can’t order relief. It can do what the system counts on you not doing:
	•	Generate court-specific styled filings with caption tables and true numbered relief.
	•	Auto-insert certificates of service, Rule 65(b) notice certifications, and proposed orders.
	•	Compute deadlines and nag you before risk turns into default.
	•	Create one-tap archive bundles (DOCX + PDF + screenshots + hashes) that survive appeals and journalism.
	•	Draft rule-comments and amicus micro-packs from your metrics—not your mood.

AI isn’t the solution to injustice; it’s the price reduction on persistence.

Four reforms that cost nothing and change everything

If court leadership wants to signal that this isn’t about preserving discretion over justice, adopt these tomorrow:
	1.	Mandatory rule citation on any return/rejection.
	2.	Required findings (facts + rule) for TRO/PI denials.
	3.	Receipt-to-docket transparency on portals (median + current queue).
	4.	Public pro se dashboards showing time-to-docket, reasonless-order rate, and returns-without-rule rate by part.

No new budget. Just sunlight.

To the bar and the academy

If your calculus insists that justice must never endanger relationships or reputations, you’ve confused professionalism with proximity to power. Teach students and associates to force legibility. Support rule changes that make your work reviewable. If that threatens comfort, ask whose comfort you were hired to protect.

⸻

To pro se litigants: you are not powerless
	•	Write your goal at the top of every draft.
	•	File with proposed orders.
	•	When you’re ignored, document the silence—and escalate.
	•	Build your record as if you’re already writing the appellate brief. Because you are.

The mission isn’t to “win” today. It’s to outlast today.

In Arizona and beyond, Judicial Calculus and Lawyer Calculus will keep routing hard cases away from daylight. Fine. Then our work is to manufacture daylight—meticulously, publicly, and in formats that can’t be quietly denied.

We won’t out-argue discretion. We will out-record it
