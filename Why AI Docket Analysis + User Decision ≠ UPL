# 🤖⚖️ AI as Tool, Not Attorney

When AI reads a docket and suggests options, but the **user makes all final decisions**, this is **not** the unauthorized practice of law (UPL). Here's why:

---

## 🔍 What AI Does (Permissible)

<aside>
AI acts as an **information processor** and **document preparation assistant** — not as a lawyer making judgments on your behalf.

</aside>

- **Reads the docket** — Analyzes entries, timelines, and procedural status (like a paralegal reviewing files)
- **Identifies procedural gaps** — Flags unruled motions, missing entries, or approaching deadlines
- **Suggests filing options** — Presents possible next steps with explanations (e.g., "You may file a Notice of Constructive Denial to preserve appellate rights")
- **Drafts documents upon request** — Creates court-formatted filings based on user instructions

---

## ✅ What the User Does (Decisive)

<aside>
The **user retains full control** over all legal strategy, decisions, and filings.

</aside>

- **Evaluates suggestions** — Reviews AI-generated options and chooses whether to act
- **Makes strategic decisions** — Decides *what* to file, *when* to file, and *what legal theory* to pursue
- **Reviews and edits drafts** — Modifies AI-generated documents to fit facts and strategy
- **Signs and files** — Takes full responsibility for the content and legal positions
- **Bears consequences** — Accepts outcomes, whether favorable or not

## ⚖️ The Legal Distinction

### ❌ This IS UPL

> AI makes independent legal judgments without user control
> 
- AI decides

*for* you what to file

- AI provides case-specific legal advice about likely outcomes
- AI files documents automatically without review
- AI represents itself as your attorney

### ✅ This is NOT UPL

> AI assists with document preparation while user controls all decisions
> 
- AI

*suggests* options; you *choose*

- AI drafts based on your instructions
- You review, edit, and approve everything
- You sign and file as a pro se litigant

## 📚 Legal Precedent Supporting AI Tools

Courts and bar associations have increasingly recognized that **legal technology tools** do not constitute UPL when they:

- **Provide information, not advice** — Explaining procedural options is educational, not advisory
- **Require user decision-making** — The human directs the process at every step
- **Function as document preparation** — Similar to templates, form-filling software, or word processors
- **Include clear disclaimers** — Stating "This is not legal advice" and "You are responsible for your filings"

## 🎯 Real-World Analogy

| **Tool** | **What It Does** | **Is It UPL?** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TurboTax | Reads tax code, suggests deductions, prepares forms | ❌ No — user decides and signs |
| LegalZoom | Generates contracts and incorporation docs | ❌ No — document preparation service |
| AI Docket Builder | Analyzes docket, suggests filings, drafts documents | ❌ No — user controls all decisions |
| Lawyer | Advises on strategy, makes judgments, represents you | ✅ Legal practice (licensed) |

## 🛡️ Safeguards That Keep AI Tools Lawful

- [ ]  Clear disclaimers that the tool provides information, not legal advice
- [ ]  User must actively review and approve all suggestions
- [ ]  User signs all filings and takes responsibility
- [ ]  AI explains procedural options without predicting case outcomes
- [ ]  Educational framing (teaching *how* to file, not *whether* to file)

---

## 💡 The Bottom Line

<aside>
**Decision-making = Practice of LawInformation + Tools = Permissible Assistance**

</aside>

When AI reads a docket and shows you options, it's like a research assistant handing you files and saying, *"Here's what I found — what do you want to do?"*

**You** are still the lawyer (pro se litigant).

**You** make the calls.

**You** file the documents.

**You** own the strategy.

The AI is just a very sophisticated typewriter with legal formatting knowledge.

## 🚀 Why This Matters

This distinction allows **pro se litigants** to access procedural literacy and document preparation tools that level the playing field — without requiring them to afford an attorney.

It empowers people to:

- Understand their procedural options
- Draft court-compliant documents
- Preserve their appellate rights
- Navigate complex legal systems with dignity

**Access to justice is not the same as the practice of law.**
