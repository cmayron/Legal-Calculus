the low pro se win rate doesn’t prove most claims lack merit. It mostly reflects who files, how federal procedure filters cases, and resource mismatches—not a clean read on “justice.”

# **Why the outcomes skew (merit ≠ outcome)**

- Selection effect. Stronger plaintiff cases more often attract counsel; tougher/complex cases skew pro se—lowering observed win rates. Federal data show pro se plaintiffs winning ~3% of final judgments (1998–2017); defendants ~12%. That’s outcomes, not a merit test.
- Procedure filters before merits. Many pro se cases are screened/dismissed on pleadings (Rule 12(b)(6), Twombly/Iqbal “plausibility”), or under 28 U.S.C. § 1915 (IFP screening), often before evidence is weighed.
- Resource & know-how gap. Courts and the FJC document that nonlawyers struggle with service, deadlines, formatting, and rules—even with court programs—so cases die on process, not necessarily merits.

# **What the evidence says about counsel vs. no counsel**

Representation can change outcomes in some forums (e.g., a randomized NYC Housing Court study found much better tenant results with counsel), though effects vary by setting and study design. Reviews of the literature emphasize context matters and we need more rigorous trials.

# **LCES’s lane (what you can control)**

Your UPL-safe workflow targets the non-merits failure points:

- Build plausible Rule 8 pleadings (clear facts, dates, elements labeled) → reduces Twiqbal dismissals.
- Nail service, deadlines, page limits, certificates, exhibit indexing → fewer “procedural KO’s.”
- Keep an audit trail (manifest + checksums) → cleaner hand-off if/when a lawyer steps in.

None of this proves the underlying claim is right or wrong—it just means the case reaches a decision on the actual facts and law, not on a technicality.

# **Bottom line**

Low pro se win rates reflect selection, procedural hurdles, and capacity gaps more than merit. LCES removes the procedural barriers so cases stand or fall on their substance.

# **Key takeaways for messaging**

- "Our low pro se win rate isn't about weak claims—it's about procedural barriers that filter cases before they reach the merits."
- "LCES levels the playing field by handling the technicalities that typically derail unrepresented litigants, letting cases be decided on their actual substance."
- "Federal procedure was designed for lawyers—LCES translates it so non-lawyers can navigate discovery, motions, and evidence rules without tripping over formatting or deadlines."
- "When cases survive to summary judgment or trial, the win rate gap narrows—proving that access to procedure, not merit, drives most of the disparity."
