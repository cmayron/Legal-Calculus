Why use the LCES app (even if you have GPT-5 Thinking)
	•	Speed under stress: One-tap checklists + copy blocks → export to PDF/Word. No back-and-forth.
	•	Consistency: Pre-vetted cards = the same reliable steps every time (great for exhibits).
	•	Fewer unforced errors: Checklists prevent misses (deadlines, notices, service).
	•	Offline + private: Works without a network; nothing to “leak.”
	•	Training effect: Micro-drills build procedural literacy so you’re calmer and faster.
	•	Use GPT for custom work: LCES = guardrails & format; GPT = tailor to your facts/citations.

How to use the app (2 modes)

Crisis mode (5-minute triage)
	1.	Open FG and search your situation (“filing,” “summons,” “hearing,” “appeal”).
	2.	Follow the Action bullets; tap Language Block; Export.
	3.	Add receipts/hashes if relevant; send/file.
	4.	If blocked by counsel/court behavior, open LCa counters.

Deep mode (build power)
	1.	Read the matching LC module (the “why/when”).
	2.	Do the FGA drill (muscle memory).
	3.	Run the FG card to execute cleanly.

Procedural literacy pillars (micro-checklists)

Filing (civil motion/complaint packet)
	•	Correct caption & case info; parties/addresses match records
	•	Required fee/IFP and signature/verification (if applicable)
	•	Memo/points & authorities + proposed order (when expected)
	•	Exhibits: labeled, paginated, cited; optional hash appendix
	•	Certificate of service + tracking/ECF receipt
	•	Local rule checks (formatting, page limits, hearing notice)
	•	Cover letter if filing by mail; no-waiver preservation line

Summons & service (new case)
	•	Court’s official summons form; names/addresses exactly as complaint
	•	Clerk issues summons (don’t serve an unsigned form)
	•	Service method compliant (personal/waiver/agent; Rule 4(m) clocks in fed)
	•	Affidavit/Proof of service filed; calendar re-issue if expired
	•	Track undeliverable mail; cure with alternate service motion if needed

Hearing etiquette (in-person/virtual)
	•	Confirm date/time/location/link; test tech; bring ID/charging
	•	2-minute opening: issue, relief, record cites; avoid argument drift
	•	Tabbed binder / linked PDF; exhibit list served ahead of time
	•	Address the court properly; don’t interrupt; note objections briefly
	•	Ask for specific relief; clarify next deadlines; offer proposed order
	•	Immediately memorialize in a short status letter/notice

Appeals (state/federal—adapt deadlines locally)
	•	Verify appealable order; start deadline clock (e.g., 30 days fed civil)
	•	File Notice of Appeal; pay fee/IFP; docketing statement if required
	•	Order transcripts/record on appeal; designate exhibits
	•	Identify issues preserved + standards of review
	•	Calendar briefing schedule; check page limits/citation rules
	•	Consider stay/supersedeas; serve all; keep a preservation file
