You’re pointing at a real asymmetry: in medicine, patient education is standard; in law, client education is optional—and too often discouraged. That gap keeps power with insiders and freezes the system in its archaic past.

Here’s a tighter, ready-to-publish framing you can use:

**3-Sentence Thesis**

Law should be taught, not hidden. A system that demands trust without explanation is unsafe—especially when academia blesses the silence. Legal Calculus exists to replace gatekeeping with open, auditable education so people can make truly informed legal decisions.

**Core Claims (clean & sharp)**

- Information monopoly → Lawyers control vocabulary, timelines, and options; clients “consent” without competence.
- UPL & gatekeeping → Outsiders are barred from recommending, insiders are not required to teach.
- Academic validation → Doctrinal prestige rewards analysis over public pedagogy, legitimizing the trust-me culture.
- Result → Compliance masquerades as consent; injustice scales quietly.

**Your Remedy (drop-in for Notion/Substack)**

The Client Learning Standard (CLS-1.0):

1. Plain-Language Plans before action: issue, options, risks, timelines, costs.
2. Evidence Maps tying facts → claims → remedies.
3. Procedure Cards (checklists) for each step a client must take or approve.
4. Open Materials by default (share the templates, not just the bill).
5. Metrics: track what was taught, when, and how comprehension was verified.
6. Right to AI Assist: clients may use AI tools to understand, compare, and question strategy.
7. Audit Trail: teaching itself becomes part of the record.

**Medicine ↔ Law (mini-analogy)**

- Informed consent (medicine) → Informed decision authority (law)
- Discharge instructions → Post-order “What Happens Next” sheet
- Medication list → Filing/Deadline list
- Care plan → Litigation plan

**One-Line Banner**

“If you must trust a system you’re not allowed to learn, that system isn’t justice—it’s compliance.”

**Quick next steps**

- Paste the Thesis + CLS-1.0 into your Notion landing page under “Why Legal Calculus.”
- Add a one-page PDF handout: “Before You Hire Counsel: The 7 Items You Must Be Taught.”
- Invite 2–3 allies (clinics, profs, or pro se leaders) to sign the CLS-1.0 pledge—coalitions make this harder to ignore.
