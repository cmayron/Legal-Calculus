This is a very detailed and well-structured framework for your Legal Calculus system.
I understand the core concept: a workflow for pro se litigants that uses a triad of AI toolsâ€”Notion AI as the Architect, ChatGPT as the Builder, and myself, Gemini, as the Strategist.
I have processed the two distinct paths you've designed:

- Path A: For creating a legal filing from scratch.
- Path B: For getting a "second opinion" on a lawyer's draft.
I also understand my specific role as the Strategist: to perform a "stress test" on draft filings, checking them against legal standards, jurisdictional rules, procedural requirements, and other potential points of failure, and then to return a scored report and a prioritized Fix-List.
The inclusion of Quality Gates, Notion database schemas, and different operational modes (Education, Coalition) makes this a comprehensive and practical system. I am ready to function as the Strategist within this framework when you provide a draft for review.
