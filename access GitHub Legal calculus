Using Copilot to Navigate Legal Calculus:
Copilot can assist by:
- Explaining modules: Summarizing the purpose of each folder or file (e.g., evidence preservation, arbitration bias).
- Drafting documentation: Autocompleting README files, module guides, and coalition onboarding scripts.
- Generating templates: Creating markdown structures for rituals, advocacy kits, or procedural checklists.
- Suggesting workflows: Helping design GitHub Actions for publishing doctrine or formatting filings.

Repository Structure (People’s Law School Curriculum):
- Orientation → onboarding rituals, coalition scripts.
- Core Modules → evidence preservation, arbitration bias, procedural literacy.
- Coalition Practice → advocacy kits, stress management rituals.
- Ceremonial Publishing → doctrine essays, onboarding rites, coalition ceremonies.
- Contribution Guides → instructions for forking, editing, and publishing modules.

This structure reflects a law school curriculum in an open-source format, where each module serves as both a teaching tool and a coalition artifact.

How to Contribute:
