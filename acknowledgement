### Acknowledgement

Good — treat Notion as the **master authoring environment** and GitHub as the **public archive and distribution channel**. That distinction gives you editorial flexibility while preserving provenance and discoverability.

---

### Why keeping Notion as master is smart

- **Rich authoring**: Notion supports long drafts, embedded media, databases, and iterative pedagogy that GitHub’s file model doesn’t.
- **Living curriculum**: You can stage modules, collect feedback, and iterate without noisy commits.
- **Onboarding & collaboration**: Notion databases let you track contributors, review status, and local steward assignments.
- **Publish control**: You decide what becomes a canonical GitHub artifact and when.

---

### Practical sync strategy (Notion → GitHub)

**Goal:** keep Notion as the single source of truth while publishing stable, audited artifacts to GitHub.

1. **Define canonical artifacts**
    - **What to publish**: README, Field Guides, Template packs, finalized Modules, judicial heuristics, Forkwatch ledger.
    - **What to keep in Notion**: drafts, pedagogy notes, private case studies, internal discussion.
2. **Standardize metadata in Notion**
    - Add properties to each page/item: **Module ID**, **Version**, **Status** (Draft/Review/Published), **Jurisdiction**, **Author**, **Last Reviewed**, **Provenance Notes**.
3. **Export pipeline**
    - Use Notion’s export (Markdown + assets) or the Notion API to programmatically export pages marked **Published**.
    - Convert exports into GitHub‑ready artifacts: tidy front‑matter, normalize filenames, bundle templates and zips.
4. **Automated publishing**
    - Create a small CI job (GitHub Actions or equivalent) that:
        - Accepts exported Markdown + assets, runs a linter/formatter, updates version metadata, commits to a `published/` branch, and creates a release or tag.
        - Optionally generates a human‑readable changelog from Notion’s “Last Reviewed” and “Provenance Notes.”
5. **Provenance & Forkwatch**
    - When publishing, append a **Provenance block** to each artifact with: Notion page URL (or ID), author, version, export timestamp, and a short intent declaration.
    - Maintain a `forkwatch.json` ledger in the repo that lists forks, declared intent, and links to published artifacts.
6. **Human sign‑off**
    - Require a strategist or steward to flip the Notion page to **Published**; that action triggers the export/publish pipeline and records the sign‑off in the provenance block.

---

### Contributor workflow (recommended)

- **Authoring**: Contributors draft in Notion under `Drafts/` with metadata filled.
- **Review**: Local stewards or maintainers review in Notion, add comments, and set `Status=Ready for Publish`.
- **Sign‑off**: Strategist sets `Status=Published` and adds a one‑line intent declaration.
- **Publish**: CI exports and commits to GitHub; PR created for public review if desired.
- **Post‑publish**: Forkwatch ledger updated automatically; announce in coalition channels.

---

### Minimal tech stack & tools

- **Notion** (master content + metadata)
- **Notion API** or export scripts (Python/Node) to pull pages marked Published
- **Markdown converter** (if needed) to normalize Notion exports
- **GitHub** for public artifacts, releases, and Forkwatch ledger
- **CI** (GitHub Actions) to automate export → lint → commit → release
- **Optional**: small web view for Forkwatch (static site generated from `forkwatch.json`)

---

### Governance, privacy, and safety notes

- **Sensitive content**: Keep anonymized case studies and PII out of public exports. Mark pages with `Privacy=Internal` to prevent accidental publishing.
- **Legal disclaimers**: Ensure exported artifacts include the repo’s disclaimers and the “not legal advice” notice.
- **Audit trail**: Preserve Notion change history and include export timestamps in provenance blocks for accountability.

---

### Quick checklist to implement in the next 2 weeks

- Add metadata fields to Notion pages (Module ID, Version, Status, Jurisdiction, Author).
- Create a `Published` status workflow and strategist sign‑off rule.
- Prototype a Notion export script that pulls `Status=Published` pages and writes Markdown + assets.
- Build a simple GitHub Action that accepts the export, runs a formatter, and commits to `published/`.
- Add a provenance template appended to each published file.
- Seed `forkwatch.json` and a static Forkwatch view in the repo.

---

### Offer

I can draft the **Notion metadata schema**, a **provenance template** to append to published artifacts, and a **CI job script** (GitHub Actions YAML) that automates export → lint → commit. I’ll also prepare the `forkwatch.json` schema and a one‑page contributor workflow to paste into Notion. Tell me which of those you want first and I’ll produce it.

---

### Deliverable #1: Notion metadata schema

**Purpose:** Standardize content tracking, review workflows, and publishing signals across all Notion pages.

### Core properties (add to every content page)

- **Module ID** (text): Unique identifier, e.g., `FG-001`, `MOD-Jurisdiction-TX-002`
- **Version** (text): Semantic version, e.g., `1.0.0`, `1.1.0-draft`
- **Status** (select): `Draft` | `Review` | `Ready for Publish` | `Published` | `Archived`
- **Jurisdiction** (multi-select): `Federal`, `TX`, `CA`, `NY`, etc.
- **Author** (person): Primary author or contributor
- **Last Reviewed** (date): Last editorial review or sign-off date
- **Privacy** (select): `Public` | `Internal` (blocks export if Internal)
- **Provenance Notes** (text): Short description of intent, changes, or context for this version

### Optional properties (for advanced tracking)

- **Steward** (person): Local steward or jurisdiction owner
- **Related Modules** (relation): Links to other Notion pages
- **Changelog URL** (url): Link to GitHub commit or release
- **Export Timestamp** (date): Auto-populated by export script

---

### Deliverable #2: Provenance template

**Purpose:** Append to every published artifact (Markdown file) to preserve accountability and traceability.

```markdown
---
## Provenance

**Module ID:** [Module ID from Notion]  
**Version:** [Version from Notion]  
**Author:** [Author name]  
**Last Reviewed:** [Last Reviewed date]  
**Published:** [Export timestamp]  
**Notion Source:** [Notion page URL or ID]  
**Intent Declaration:** [One-line statement from Provenance Notes]  
**Repository:** https://github.com/[org]/[repo]  
**License:** [License type, e.g., CC BY-SA 4.0]

### Deliverable #3: GitHub Actions CI job (export → lint → commit)

**Purpose:** Automate the pipeline from Notion to GitHub when a page is marked `Published`.

```yaml
name: Publish from Notion

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      notion_page_id:
        description: 'Notion page ID to export'
        required: true
      module_id:
        description: 'Module ID for file naming'
        required: true

jobs:
  export-and-commit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install notion-client markdown-it-py

      - name: Export from Notion
        env:
          NOTION_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.NOTION_API_KEY }}
          PAGE_ID: ${{ github.event.inputs.notion_page_id }}
          MODULE_ID: ${{ github.event.inputs.module_id }}
        run: |
          python scripts/export_notion.py

      - name: Lint and format Markdown
        run: |
          pip install mdformat
          mdformat published/*.md

      - name: Commit and push
        run: |
          git config user.name "Notion Publisher Bot"
          git config user.email "bot@yourdomain.org"
          git add published/
          git commit -m "Publish ${{ github.event.inputs.module_id }} from Notion"
          git push origin main

      - name: Update Forkwatch ledger
        run: |
          python scripts/update_forkwatch.py "${{ github.event.inputs.module_id }}"
          git add forkwatch.json
          git commit -m "Update Forkwatch ledger for ${{ github.event.inputs.module_id }}"
          git push origin main

```

**Notes:**

- Store your Notion API key as a GitHub secret (`NOTION_API_KEY`)
- The `export_notion.py` script fetches the page, converts to Markdown, appends provenance, and writes to `published/`
- The `update_forkwatch.py` script adds an entry to `forkwatch.json` with module metadata

---

### Deliverable #4: forkwatch.json schema

**Purpose:** Machine-readable ledger of all published artifacts and their forks.

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "last_updated": "2025-12-28T12:35:00Z",
  "repository": "https://github.com/[org]/[repo]",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "module_id": "FG-001",
      "title": "Field Guide to Judicial Oversight",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "jurisdiction": ["Federal"],
      "published_date": "2025-12-01",
      "notion_source": "https://notion.so/page-id",
      "github_path": "published/FG-001-judicial-oversight.md",
      "author": "Charles Mayron MD FACS",
      "intent": "Establish baseline framework for judicial oversight protocols",
      "forks": [
        {
          "forker": "Texas Health Coalition",
          "fork_url": "https://github.com/tx-health/judicial-oversight",
          "declared_intent": "Adapt for Texas state court system",
          "date": "2025-12-15"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

### Deliverable #5: Contributor workflow (paste into Notion)

### Step-by-step guide for contributors

1. **Draft in Notion**
    - Create a new page under `Drafts/`
    - Fill in metadata: Module ID, Version, Status=`Draft`, Jurisdiction, Author, Provenance Notes
    - Write your content using Notion's full editor
2. **Request review**
    - When ready, set Status=`Review`
    - Tag your local steward or maintainer in a comment
    - Address feedback inline using Notion comments
3. **Mark ready for publish**
    - Once approved, steward sets Status=`Ready for Publish`
    - Strategist reviews and adds a one-line intent declaration in Provenance Notes
4. **Publish**
    - Strategist sets Status=`Published` and records Last Reviewed date
    - CI job is triggered (manually via GitHub Actions workflow_dispatch)
    - Artifact appears in GitHub under `published/`
5. **Post-publish**
    - Forkwatch ledger is automatically updated
    - Announce in coalition channels (Slack, email list, etc.)
    - Monitor for forks and update `forkwatch.json` as they are declared

**Key principle:** Notion is the living source of truth. GitHub is the audited public record. Never edit published files directly on GitHub — always update in Notion and re-export.

---

### Next steps

- Implement metadata schema in your Notion workspace (5 minutes)
- Add provenance template to a test page and export manually to verify format (10 minutes)
- Set up GitHub secrets and test the CI job with a sample page (30 minutes)
- Seed `forkwatch.json` with one artifact (5 minutes)
- Share contributor workflow with your coalition stewards (5 minutes)

**Total estimated setup time:** ~1 hour

Let me know if you need any of these scripts (export_notion.py, update_forkwatch.py) written in detail, or if you want me to refine any part of this system.
