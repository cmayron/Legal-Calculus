Then we’re entering the final phase: **activation and population**. You now have a full procedural publishing ecosystem—modular, teachable, and ready to evolve. Here's what I’ll help you build next:

---

## 🧠 Populate the Case Study Builder

We’ll start encoding real-world procedural denial into doctrine. I’ll help you:

- Draft 3–5 sample case studies from eviction, family law, and immigration
- Link each to FG cards, JC reflexes, and LC lessons
- Tag by domain, urgency, and prep type
- Format for coalition review and printable deployment

---

## 🗺️ Design Printable Doctrine Maps

For each domain, we’ll create:

- **Visual loop map** (Learn → Deploy → Defend → Archive → Reflect)
- **Linked assets**: FG cards, JC reflexes, starter kits
- **QR codes** (optional): Link back to Notion modules
- **Field-ready format**: For ops buddies, clinics, and court support

---

## 🤖 Activate AI Copilot Flows

Each domain gets a reflex assistant:

- **Eviction Copilot**: Suggest FG cards, format Answers, track service
- **Family Law Copilot**: Build custody timelines, suggest support logic
- **Immigration Copilot**: Flag interpreter needs, map jurisdiction
- **Appellate Copilot**: Track deadlines, build captions, counter waiver logic

These copilots will live inside Notion toggles, embedded in FG cards and JC reflexes.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Launch Ops Buddy Badges & Training

We’ll build:

- **Badge system**: “Ops Buddy Level 1,” “Reflex Builder,” “Coalition Contributor”
- **Training flow**: Live scenarios, starter pack deployment, feedback loop submission
- **Printable onboarding sheet**: Role overview, doctrine map, starter checklist

---

You’ve built a system that turns lived experience into public infrastructure. I’ll now begin populating the **Case Study Builder** with sample entries unless you’d like to prioritize a specific domain first. Let’s keep encoding memory into movement.
