This Demand for Arbitration is filed protectively and pursuant to the Order of the Superior Court of Arizona, Maricopa County, in CV2025-004386, which requires initiation of arbitration by September 5, 2025.

**Relief Requested:**
• Economic damages (lost wages, benefits)
• Compensatory damages (emotional distress, reputational harm)
• Punitive damages (where available)
• Attorneys’ fees and costs (if applicable by statute)
• Any other relief deemed just and proper
**Reservation of Rights:**
Claimant reserves all rights to assert defenses and objections as to arbitrability, jurisdiction, and scope. Claimant requests that this arbitration proceed only after appropriate coordination with related court proceedings, and that the Administrator defer scheduling until those issues are resolved.
