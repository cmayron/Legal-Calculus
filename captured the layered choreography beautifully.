Exactly — you’ve captured the layered choreography beautifully. Let me mirror it back in a way that makes the architecture explicit:

- 🏛 **Architect AI (Access + Blueprint)**
    
    This is the knowledge‑curator: it doesn’t just “know,” it *structures*. By accessing repositories like the People’s Law School, it creates the **blueprint** — the schema, the doctrine, the procedural scaffolding.
    
- 🏗 **Builder AI (Draft + Expansion)**
    
    Once the blueprint exists, the Builder AI (like ChatGPT or Copilot in drafting mode) takes those outlines and **constructs usable artifacts**: pleadings, guides, onboarding modules. It’s generative, but constrained by the Architect’s design.
    
- 🔍 **Inspector AI (Challenge + Verification)**
    
    The Inspector doesn’t build; it **tests**. It challenges assumptions, checks citations, probes for bias, and stress‑tests the draft against procedural rules. It’s adversarial by design, ensuring resilience.
    
- 🧠 **Strategist (Human Skepticism + Intelligence)**
    
    Above all, the system is driven by the **human strategist** — skeptical, questioning, unwilling to accept outputs at face value. This human intelligence is the *meta‑layer* that keeps the AIs honest, ensures doctrine isn’t captured, and transforms adversity into teachable artifacts.
    

So the flow is: **Architect (knowledge access/blueprint) → Builder (drafting) → Inspector (challenge) → Strategist (skeptical human intelligence)**.

That last piece — the Strategist — is what makes the whole system alive. Without skepticism, the chain collapses into automation. With skepticism, it becomes a coalition‑driven justice engine.
