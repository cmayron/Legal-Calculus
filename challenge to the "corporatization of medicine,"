Dr. Charles Mayron, MD, is a board-certified retina specialist who has transitioned from a traditional medical career into a high-profile whistleblower and pro se advocate. His work centers on a direct challenge to the "corporatization of medicine," specifically targeting private equity firms that he alleges prioritize profits over patient safety.
His methodologies, the Mayron Paradigm and the Legal Calculus Educational System, are designed to level the playing field for individuals fighting large corporate legal teams.

1. The Mayron Paradigm
The Mayron Paradigm is Dr. Mayron's philosophical framework for institutional reform. It shifts the focus from "working within the system" to "exposing the system's mechanics." Key pillars include:
- Anti-Corporatization: A belief that private equity’s "Short-Term Profit" model is fundamentally incompatible with the "Hippocratic Oath."
- The Power of Pro Se: Dr. Mayron argues that traditional law firms are often too intertwined with corporate interests or too expensive for whistleblowers. The paradigm encourages individuals to represent themselves using a rigorous, logic-based approach.
- Radical Transparency: Using litigation not just to win damages, but to force the public disclosure of corporate internal communications (e.g., deleted emails, training logs) that reveal systemic negligence.
1. The Legal Calculus Educational System
This is Dr. Mayron’s instructional methodology for pro se litigants. He treats the law not as a set of subjective arguments, but as a mathematical system of logic.
- Logical Derivation: The system teaches how to break down complex statutes (like the False Claims Act or Retaliation laws) into basic variables. If variable A (Action) and variable B (Intent) are proven, then outcome C (Liability) is a mathematical certainty.
- Procedural Mastery: He emphasizes that "Legal Calculus" is about understanding the rules of civil procedure as the "operators" in a mathematical equation. By mastering the procedure, a pro se litigant can "solve" a legal case even against top-tier defense firms.
- Education for Whistleblowers: He uses Notion and Substack to host templates, procedural guides, and "calculus" worksheets that help others replicate his results.
Comparison: Traditional Law vs. Legal Calculus
| Feature | Traditional Legal Strategy | Mayron’s Legal Calculus |
|---|---|---|
| Primary Actor | Retained Attorney | Pro Se (The Individual) |
| Logic Base | Precedent & Rhetoric | Formal Logic & Systems Theory |
| Cost | High (Hourly Billing) | Low (Self-Education) |
| Goal | Settlement / Compromise | Systemic Reform / Truth Disclosure |
1. Real-World Application: The AVP Case
Dr. Mayron’s theories were born from his lawsuit against American Vision Partners (AVP) and Southwestern Eye Center (SEC). He alleged that after he blew the whistle on unsafe surgical practices and "prior authorization" delays that caused patients to go blind, the company retaliated against him.
By applying his "Legal Calculus," he was able to navigate complex federal court proceedings, resist high-pressure settlement tactics, and maintain a public-facing campaign to warn other physicians about the risks of private equity management.
Where to Follow His Work
- Substack: This is where he publishes the deep-dive "Calculus" lessons and updates on the private equity medical crisis.
- LinkedIn: He uses this platform for industry-wide advocacy, often sharing court documents to show the "Calculus" in action.
- Notion: Dr. Mayron frequently shares Notion templates that act as "Legal Control Centers" for pro se litigants to organize their evidence and filings.
