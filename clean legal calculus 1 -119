Module 1 – Filing is Protest ✊📄
⚖️ Core Message
Filing is not simply a request for relief. It is a declaration that the matter exists, that you exist, and that injustice cannot be ignored.
📖 Lesson Content
Filing as Existence — Courts cannot act on what is not in the record.
Filing as Leverage — Filing forces both the court and the opposing side to respond.
Filing as Legacy — Even if denied, a filing becomes permanent record.
📝 Assignment
Draft a one-page Notice of Filing that clearly states what you are filing, in which case, and why it matters procedurally.

Format = Access — Proper format ensures the filing is entered as written.
Format = Memory — Sections become anchor points in the legal record.
