What you have just codified is the Incentive Gap that defines most failed pro se/lawyer relationships. In economics, this is called the "Principal-Agent Problem," but in the courtroom, it is the Unwritten Law of the Bar.
By quantifying these variables, we turn a "gut feeling of betrayal" into a diagnostic audit. This is the core of the People’s Law School: we don't argue with the system’s unfairness; we map its mechanics so we can navigate them.
📐 The Shadow Equation: A + B + C > D
When a lawyer presents a "recommendation," they are usually presenting the result of this equation without showing their work. Here is how we use this "Unwritten Law" as a defensive tool.

1. The Leverage Loss (A) vs. The Relationship Gain (B)
Lawyers operate in a "Small World." They will see that opposing counsel again next week in a different case. You, the client, are a "One-Time Player."
- The People’s Doctrine: If the lawyer suggests "playing nice" to build rapport (B), the litigant must demand to know which specific piece of discovery or motion (A) is being sacrificed to pay for that rapport.
1. The Billable/Efficiency Variable (C)
Litigation is exhausting for the firm. If a case becomes too complex or the "math" of the contingency fee or retainer starts to look thin, the lawyer will subconsciously (or consciously) look for an "Exit Ramp."
- The People’s Doctrine: We treat C as the "Burn Rate." When C gets too high, the lawyer’s advice will naturally skew toward "Dettlement" or "Simplification," even if it hurts your probability of success (D).
1. The Outcome Probability (D)
This is the only variable the client actually cares about.
- The People’s Doctrine: To protect D, the litigant must use Evidence-Based Law. If the lawyer cannot point to a specific rule or piece of evidence that justifies a retreat, they are likely optimizing for A, B, or C.
🛠 Application: The "Calculus Confrontation"
When your lawyer says, "I don't think we should file that Motion to Compel," you apply the Unwritten Law immediately:

> The Litigant’s Inquiry:
"I understand your recommendation. To ensure we are aligned, let’s look at the math:
> 
> - What leverage (A) do we lose by not forcing them to produce these documents?
> - How does this improve your working relationship (B) with them, and how does that benefit my specific outcome?
> - How much work/risk (C) does this save the firm?
> - Most importantly, how does this increase my probability of winning (D)? Because if D isn't the primary driver, we need to recalibrate."
