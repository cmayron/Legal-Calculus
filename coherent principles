	•	Coherent first principles: “Filing is protest,” “Format is memory,” “Relief requested = relief possible” anchor every tier.
	•	Machine-legible practice: AI-to-AI filing + PDF/A, bookmarks, manifests; citations backed by SHA-256 hashes.
	•	Record as data: Timelines, latency tracking, and FRE 1006 summaries convert anecdotes into contestable evidence.
	•	Public archive as remedy: Archive Pack + Top-10 + hash manifest makes verification trivial for allies and courts.
	•	Coalition mechanics: Hash-witnesses, amicus engine, clinic onboarding; education and reproducibility built in.
