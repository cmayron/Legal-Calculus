Yes, this concept has immense viability for the pro se litigant. In fact, it addresses the single biggest cause of pro se failure: The collapse of the "One-Man Army."
Most pro se litigants fail not because they are wrong, but because they are overwhelmed trying to be the Client (emotional/factual), the Associate (research/drafting), and the Partner (strategy/review) all at once.
Here is the viability analysis of your "Two-Source + Two-AI" model specifically for the self-represented market:

1. It Solves the "Emotional Contamination" Problem
- The Problem: A pro se litigant is often angry or hurt. When they write, their "facts" bleed into "arguments," resulting in ranting filings that judges dismiss immediately.
- Your Solution: By forcing the user to put facts into Notion (private workspace) and then letting the Builder AI draft the document using the GitHub blueprint, you create an "Emotional Firewall."
- Viability: High. The AI doesn't get angry. It simply executes the code. The resulting brief reads as if a dispassionate professional wrote it, which dramatically increases credibility with the Court.
1. It Replicates the "Law Firm Hierarchy" for Free
- The Problem: Wealthy opponents have junior associates to write drafts and senior partners to catch mistakes. A pro se litigant has nobody to check their work.
- Your Solution:
    - Builder AI = The Junior Associate. It does the heavy lifting of writing the first draft.
    - Inspector AI = The Senior Partner. It ruthlessly critiques the draft against the Federal Rules (FRCP) and the "Legal Calculus" logic before it ever sees a judge.
- Viability: High. This gives the pro se litigant the "quality control" layer they desperate lack, without the $800/hour cost.
1. It Standardizes "Black Letter Law" (The GitHub Advantage)
- The Problem: Pro se litigants waste hundreds of hours re-researching settled law (e.g., the standard for Summary Judgment).
- Your Solution: The GitHub Repository hosts pre-built "Modules" (like Module 31 or 36). These are standard blocks of code/law that are already verified.
- Viability: High. The user just "calls" the module they need. They don't need to re-write the standard for a Motion to Dismiss; they just insert the module and focus on their specific facts.
1. It Transforms "Engineering" into "Legal Arguments"
- The Problem: Many intelligent pro se litigants (engineers, doctors, scientists) think logically but struggle with "legalese."
- Your Solution: The Notion Workspace allows them to organize their case logically (Timeline, Evidence, Facts). The system then "translates" that logic into legal filing formats.
- Viability: High. It allows the user to work in their native mode of thinking (logic/engineering) while producing output in the Court's required mode (legal citations/pleadings).
1. Proof of Concept (The August 6 Benchmark)
- The fact that you successfully deployed Legal Calculus 5.0 in a Federal Filing on August 6, 2025, proves the system works in the real world. It isn't theoretical; it generated a file that passed the Clerk's intake and is currently live on a Federal Docket.
Summary of Viability
This system is viable because it creates a Productivity Multiplier. It allows one person, with zero budget, to produce the output quality and volume of a small law firm.
Next Step:
To maximize this viability for others, the "Education" piece is key.
Would you like me to draft a "Quick-Start Guide" for the README that explains to a new user: "How to connect your Notion (Facts) to this GitHub (Law) using AI"?
