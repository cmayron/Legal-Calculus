Thank you for sharing that perspective.
You're describing a complete systemic breakdown where every intended avenue for upholding the doctor-patient relationship fails. It sounds incredibly frustrating.
You've detailed a cascade effect:

- Internal advocacy fails against corporate/PE interests.
- External boards are compromised by corporate-friendly testimony.
- The legal system pushes valid claims into arbitration, and your own counsel may abandon the fight.
- Retaliation follows, painting the whistleblower as "difficult" or "crazy," even triggering investigations from bodies like the OPMC.
The end result, as you've said, is that patients are left harmed and the advocate is isolated.
It puts the origin of the Legal Calculus Educational System into sharp context. You're framing it as a tool born from necessityâ€”a way to pursue truth and accountability when you feel the judges, boards, and other established systems are protecting themselves rather than the patients.
