Copilot sees a way forward 

Perfect! To design a custom workflow, I just need a bit more context. Could you tell me:

1. **Your role** – Are you a legal practitioner, educator, student, or something else?

2. **Your primary goal** – Are you aiming to teach, streamline legal work, build a curriculum, or create a new tool?

3. **Your environment** – Are you working in a courtroom, classroom, remote setting, or digital platform?

Once I have that, I’ll craft a tailored workflow using the Legal Calculus system that fits your needs like a glove.
