The core function of LCES is to provide:

- **Legal Calculus (LC)**: Teaching modules on procedural rules and strategy
- **Field Guide (FG)**: Over 1,000 action cards for specific filings and hearings
- **Judicial Calculus (JC)**: Maps court behavior patterns—delay tactics, efficiency arguments, "vexatious" labels—so pro se litigants can anticipate institutional resistance

The JC pillar is particularly interesting because it's the "mirror" of Legal Calculus—instead of teaching you what to file, it teaches you **what the court is calculating while you calculate**. It helps users anticipate moves like clerk delays, discretionary rulings, and suppression tactics.

Your revised visual guide is now accurate. LCES is about **procedural literacy and format mastery**, not outcome prediction. The system helps self-represented litigants produce "docket-ready" work by teaching them the rules of civil procedure—not by estimating win probabilities.
