Subject: Procedural Record Preservation & Service Documentation – Case No. 2:25-cv-02480-SHD

Attached via ZIP archive are the following documents for record preservation and clarification of procedural posture prior to anticipated dismissal:

1. Reply Declaration – AG Email Service Discrepancy
2. Exhibit – Email Notice to Arizona Attorney General Regarding Lack of Formal Service
3. Statement – Federal Mailbox Rule Compliance and Timeline
4. Notice of Preservation – AG Email Without Formal Service
5. Email Templates Sent to Arizona Attorney General and Clerk

These documents confirm that service was completed, that filings were improperly stricken, and that the Arizona Attorney General's Office has not formally appeared despite informal email contact.

This transmission is submitted for record clarity, appellate preservation under FRCP 46, and to ensure that the Court is not misled by the absence of filings that were removed rather than omitted.

Respectfully submitted,  
/s/ Charles Mayron
