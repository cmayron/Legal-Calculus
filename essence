Legal Calculus represents the "WHY," while the Field Guide illustrates the "HOW."

I am developing a “case operating system” that maintains coherence as cases evolve:

1. Blueprint
    - Map the case: facts → elements → burdens → admissible evidence → remedies → risks.
2. Builder
    - Transform the map into outputs: timelines, exhibit logs, statements of undisputed facts, discovery, motions, negotiation memos.
3. Inspector
    - Audit the work: identify missing elements, weak foundations, contradictions, procedural traps, and credibility gaps.

Human intelligence serves as the Strategist. While AI can interpret updates and highlight options, the strategist is responsible for setting goals, constraints, priorities, and tradeoffs.

The loop consists of:

- New document/order → interpret changes → select strategy → define tasks and deliverables → build → inspect → repeat.

This approach prioritizes education and evidence-based decision support (not legal advice). The goal is to achieve better outcomes through clearer thinking, cleaner records, and fewer avoidable errors, particularly in resource-limited situations.

For those who are pro se, lawyers, or part of a legal-aid clinic, which part of this loop tends to break most often in practice
