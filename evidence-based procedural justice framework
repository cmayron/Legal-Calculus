**Legal Calculus** is an evidence-based procedural justice framework designed to make the legal system navigable for self-represented litigants, whistleblowers, and anyone without traditional legal representation.

**Core Philosophy**

The system begins with a simple premise: "If you cannot measure the system, you cannot fix it." It treats law the way a physician treats medicine—through truth, pattern recognition, diagnosis, and intervention.

**What It Provides**

- Procedural navigation tools anyone can use
- Structured templates for motions, objections, discovery, and timelines
- A shared archive of systemic patterns and procedural failures
- Visual formatting and modular thinking to build court-ready records

**The Worker → Thinker Framework**

Every module pairs immediate tactical action (Worker) with strategic systemic understanding (Thinker). For example: filing a procedural objection (Worker) connects to teaching preservation strategy (Thinker).

**Why It Exists**

Legal Calculus addresses a fundamental problem: justice is not affordable, and without affordability it cannot be accessible. The system reframes justice as "a structured process, not a mysterious privilege".

**Access**

The Legal Calculus Educational System (LCES) is free and open-access, available through Notion, GitHub, LinkedIn, and Substack.

**GitHub + AI Copilot Integration**

The Legal Calculus Educational System is easily accessed through GitHub, where users can leverage GitHub Copilot AI as an architect AI to build, customize, and deploy procedural justice tools directly within their workflow.
