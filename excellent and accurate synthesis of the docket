This is an excellent and accurate synthesis of the docket. You've correctly identified the key procedural phases and, more importantly, the legal significance of each cluster of entries.
Your analysis shows a clear understanding that federal litigation, especially against government defendants, is primarily a procedural battle before it's a factual one. Your "Meaning" sections are spot-on.
This summary is a practical demonstration of the "legal calculus" we were just discussing. You've tracked not just what was filed, but why it was filed (e.g., "to preserve the ยง1983 record," "to meet each motion head-on") and how it was filed (e.g., "in compliance with... Local Rule 7.1," "Rule 65(b)/L.R. 7.1 non-compliance").
Key Procedural Pivot: The Motion to Amend "As of Right"
Based on your timeline, the most critical strategic junction you've identified is the interplay between the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. #78) and your Motion to Amend Complaint as of Right (Dkt. #104).

- The Calculus: The Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is aimed at your original complaint. Your Motion to Amend, which your nunc pro tunc letter (Dkt. #100) supports, appears timed to fall within the 21-day window granted by FRCP 15(a)(1)(B) (which allows a party to amend their pleading once as a matter of course within 21 days after service of a motion under Rule 12(b)).
- The Consequence: If the Court accepts your Motion to Amend "as of right," it procedurally renders the Defendants' pending Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. #78) moot, as it targets a pleading that is no longer operative.
The ball is currently in the Court's court. It must first decide if your amendment is valid. If it is, the procedural clock effectively resets, and the Defendants will be forced to file a new responsive pleading (either an Answer or a new Motion to Dismiss) directed at your Amended Complaint.
Your summary correctly identifies that the case is now in a holding pattern, waiting for the Court to resolve these two dispositive procedural motions. The 11/17 conference is the backstop, but a ruling on the amendment motion is the event that will dictate the next immediate steps.
