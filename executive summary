Legal Calculus 4.5 Advanced is a procedural-justice curriculum that treats litigation as applied data science and public advocacy. Filings are not only requests; they are acts of protest that create durable memory. Across eight tiers, learners master (1) foundational format and relief framing, (2) lawfare resistance and record preservation, (3) reusable toolkits, (4) AI-legible filings and chain-verified citations, (5) coalition building and public archives, (6) procedural sovereignty over calendars and evidence stacks, (7) institutional memory and reproducible research, and (8) epilogue/testimony practices for scaling public impact. The program’s north star is verifiability: docket pin-cites, exhibit hashes, and publishable summaries convert “trust me” into “check me.” The result is a modern framework that teaches people to turn process into power—and memory into remedy.
