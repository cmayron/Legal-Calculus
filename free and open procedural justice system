Legal Calculus is a free, open procedural-justice curriculum that turns litigation into verifiable public memory. We teach people to file AI-legible briefs with chain-verified citations (ECF pin-cites + SHA-256 hashes), convert delays into data under FRE 1006, and publish an Archive Pack that strangers can verify in two clicks. Our Option A/B micro-orders make relief easy to grant; our tools and education packs let clinics and journalists help without guesswork. The result: fewer silent denials, faster remedial orders, and a durable public record that institutions canâ€™t ignore.
