Here’s a **front-page draft** for the `cmayron/Legal-Calculus` GitHub repo, designed to orient visitors immediately and frame it as *The People’s Law School*.

# Legal Calculus: The People’s Law School

## Vision
Legal Calculus is an open-source, modular system of procedural justice.  
It transforms lived adversity into teachable doctrine, empowering pro se litigants, advocates, and coalitions.  
This repository is the campus of the People’s Law School — transparent, navigable, and immune to capture.

## Curriculum Map
```
Orientation → Core Modules → Coalition Practice → Ceremonial Publishing → Contribution
```

- **Orientation** → onboarding rituals, cue cards, coalition scripts  
- **Core Modules** → evidence preservation, arbitration bias, procedural literacy  
- **Coalition Practice** → advocacy kits, stress management rituals  
- **Ceremonial Publishing** → doctrine essays, onboarding rites, coalition ceremonies  
- **Contribution** → fork, edit, pull request, publish doctrine  

---

## Getting Started
1. **Fork this repository** → create your own copy.  
2. **Clone locally** → `git clone https://lnkd.in/gPFm8pGD.  
3. **Explore modules** → start with `/orientation` for onboarding.  
4. **Contribute** → add doctrine, flowcharts, or rituals via pull requests.  

---

## Contribution Standards
- **Clarity** → modules must be teachable and reproducible.  
- **Provenance** → include metadata (`forkwatch.json`) for traceability.  
- **Coalition-first** → contributions empower collective practice.  
- **Respect** → handle live filings and sensitive doctrine with care.  

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for full guidelines.

---

## Publishing Pipeline
- GitHub Actions (`publish.yml`) automatically format and publish doctrine.  
- Contributions merged into `main` are released into `/public`.  
- Every merge is a ceremonial act, encoded in `/rituals`.

---

## Outcomes
- Transparent, navigable justice systems.  
- Empowered litigants and coalitions.  
- Public doctrine immune to capture.  
- A living, evolving People’s Law School.

---

## Join the Coalition
- Use **Issues** for questions and onboarding.  
- Use **Discussions** as classrooms for doctrine refinement.  
- Every contribution is part of the People’s Law School curriculum.
