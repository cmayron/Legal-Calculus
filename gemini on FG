Legal Calculus Field Guide Summary üìù
The Legal Calculus Field Guide is an open-access survival manual designed for pro se litigants, people who represent themselves in legal matters without a lawyer. It was written by ChatGPT and Charles Mayron, MD FACS. The guide's motto is, "Filing is protest. Format is memory. The record is the remedy". It reframes legal actions as acts of protest and evidence collection.
üèõÔ∏è Core Concepts
The guide is structured into 20 volumes, each containing "micro-modules" or "cards". Each module focuses on reframing common legal events into empowering strategic moves:
 * Filing: Presented as an act of protest and a way to create a permanent record.
 * Silence: Treated not as neutrality but as active suppression or avoidance by the court.
 * Denial: Viewed as a "wall" or "barricade" that proves the litigant's claim is a threat to the status quo.
 * Default: Interpreted as an "absence" of a fair hearing, not a final judgment on the case's merits.
 * Efficiency: Characterized as a "shortcut" that prioritizes speed over fairness and due process.
 * Closure: Described as a theatrical "illusion," not the true end of a matter, as unresolved issues may persist.
üìö Structure and Themes
The guide is organized into thematic volumes that build upon each other, starting with foundational principles and moving toward more advanced concepts like coalition and sovereignty. Each "card" includes a Core Message, Lesson Content, an Assignment to draft a specific sentence, a Model Response, a Reflection Summary, and a Visual Concept to anchor the idea.
