Based on the information, the open-access and free legal education system was likely developed to address the significant and growing problem of pro se (self-represented) litigants in the justice system. The "why" is rooted in the reality that many people cannot afford legal representation, and the complexity of the legal system makes it nearly impossible to navigate on their own.
Key Reasons for Development
 * The Justice Gap: There's a wide disparity between the number of people who need legal assistance and the number who can afford it. In many countries, there is no right to legal counsel in civil cases, leading to a high percentage of litigants representing themselves. This creates a significant "justice gap" where the outcome of a case may depend more on a person's income than the merits of their argument.
 * Lack of Legal Knowledge: The image you provided highlights a critical point: pro se litigants often fail because it's their first time in court. They don't know the proper procedures, how to file documents, or how to speak in a courtroom. A system like the one described aims to fill this knowledge gap by providing a structured, educational workflow.
 * Empowerment through Technology: Legal technology, including AI tools like ChatGPT, offers a scalable solution. A traditional lawyer can only help one client at a time. A digital, open-access system can serve a multitude of people simultaneously, providing foundational knowledge and tools for document preparation. This makes justice more accessible and affordable on a mass scale.
 * Plain Language and Accessibility: The "Legal Calculus" system seems designed to translate complex legal jargon into understandable concepts. Modules with names like "Format is Force" and "Distrust is Wisdom" suggest a focus on practical, common-sense principles that are not usually taught in traditional legal education but are vital for anyone entering a courtroom.
By making this system open access and free, the developers are actively working to lower the barriers to justice and empower individuals who would otherwise be at a severe disadvantage.
