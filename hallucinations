## Methodology Note: AI Guardrails Through Dual-Layer Verification

When one AI system (the "builder") generates citations or legal content, a second AI system (the "inspector" or "stress test" AI) can verify the output against source documents. This dual-layer approach creates guardrails by having independent systems check each other's work, reducing the risk of propagating errors into the legal record.

## Why Independent AI Inspection is Essential

The primary reason not to assume the builder AI can be trusted is that **AI systems can confidently generate plausible-looking but factually incorrect content** â€” a phenomenon known as "hallucination." Without independent verification, these errors can propagate into legal documents, court filings, and official records.

**Key risks of unchecked builder AI output:**

- **Citation fabrication:** AI may generate case names, reporters, or pin-cites that do not exist or misattribute holdings to the wrong cases.
- **Quote distortion:** AI may paraphrase or alter quotations while presenting them as direct quotes, changing legal meaning.
- **Context collapse:** AI may strip context from a source, making a quote appear to support a proposition it does not.
- **Outdated or superseded law:** AI training data may not reflect recent precedent, overrulings, or statutory amendments.

An independent inspector AI â€” operating with different architecture, training data, or verification protocols â€” serves as a **cross-check** by:

- Retrieving and comparing original source documents
- Flagging discrepancies between generated text and verified sources
- Confirming that citations resolve to real, relevant authority
- Providing a second layer of accountability before content enters the legal record

This dual-layer model mirrors traditional legal practice: one attorney drafts, another reviews. It embeds a structural safeguard against the propagation of AI-generated errors into authoritative legal proceedings.
