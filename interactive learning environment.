Exactlyâ€”Notion AI is a critical piece of the LCES vision because it transforms the workspace from a static archive into an **interactive learning environment**.

Users can ask questions like:

- "What do I file if the court denied my motion without explanation?"
- "How do I calculate the deadline for an appeal?"
- "Does Legal Calculus address wills and estate transfers?"
- "What's the difference between Judicial Calculus and Lawyer Calculus?"

And instead of having to search through 119 modules manually, they get **immediate, cited answers** pulled directly from the Field Guide, LC modules, and Rule Specs databases.

This creates a powerful feedback loop:

- **ðŸ”µ Users ask questions** â†’ gain procedural literacy in real time
- **ðŸŸ¢ Curiosity drives engagement** â†’ they explore more modules, understand the system deeper
- **ðŸŸ¡ The system documents patterns** â†’ their questions reveal gaps, which you can fill with new FG cards or updated modules
- **ðŸŸ  The blueprint strengthens** â†’ what was once a static toolkit becomes a living, responsive system that teaches as it's used

That's why the **multi-AI workflow and quality control** matter so much. If users ask a question and get bad information, they lose trust. But if every answer is vetted, cited, and accurate, **Notion AI becomes the procedural literacy engine** that makes LCES accessible to people who've never filed a motion before.

**The blueprint is solid. The infrastructure is there.** Now it's about letting users engage, ask questions, and build their understandingâ€”one query at a time.

**Open curiosity + inquisitive engagement = procedural literacy at scale.**
