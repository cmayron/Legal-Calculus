Here’s the short version: Legal Calculus turns “I think I have a case” into a repeatable, checklisted workflow that produces clean filings, evidence-driven arguments, and preserved procedural rights. It does that with three layers that work together:

- LC (Modules 1–119): the teaching system—why each step matters and how to do it.
- FG (Field Guide 1–1000): micro-cards for the moment you’re drafting, filing, serving, or arguing.
- LCA / FGA (Advanced): deeper playbooks for complex posture (injunctions, abstention, appeals, admin cross-over).

Below is the practical “what you get” for both pro se litigants and legal professionals.

# **1) Core scaffolding you use every time**

- Claim → Element → Proof Table (evidence map): keeps arguments non-conclusory and ties each element to exhibits, witnesses, and record cites.
- Procedural Timeline & Deadline Grid: jurisdiction/venue, limitations, service, motion clocks, appeal preservation—all in one view.
- Filing Packets: complaint/motion/appeal kits with standard sections (caption, jurisdiction, facts, claims, prayer, exhibits, proposed order, proof of service).
- Exhibit Discipline: numbered index, short purpose line, “what this proves” tag, and consistent stamping.
- Service & Notice Log: method, address, date/time, receipts; mailbox-rule proof built in.
- Relief Matrix: match remedy to harm and posture (e.g., TRO/PI factors; tailoring; bond; scope).
- Archive-as-Remedy: versions, hashes, and a simple manifest so the record itself is your safety net.
    
    # Motto: Filing is protest. Format is memory. The record is the remedy.
    

# **2) Standard workflows (grab-and-go)**

- New matter intake (90-minute sprint): issue spotting → element/proof table → procedural grid → draft caption & prayer → exhibit shortlist → service plan.
- Emergency relief (TRO/PI): facts → element proofs → four-factor worksheet → declarations → proposed order → certificate of service → hearing script.
- Hearing kit: anchors, 30/60/90-second opening, “trap → counter” cards, exhibit quick-pulls, and a debrief log.
- After an order: reconsideration checklist, notice of appeal timing, record citations, and error-preservation table.

# **3) What pro se litigants get**

- Plain-language checklists that prevent the usual wounds: missed deadlines, conclusory claims, bad service, unlabeled exhibits, and unpreserved issues.
- Field Guide micro-cards you can literally read while filling a form or addressing the court.
- Script builders (hearing openings, concise asks) and “buddy-check” prompts to reduce isolation and second-guessing.
    - Tip: form a tiny peer-review circle (even one trusted friend or a clinic volunteer). If the stress is heavy, a therapist can be a steady weekly check-in so the case doesn’t swallow your life.

# **4) What legal professionals get**

- Consistency at scale: associates and staff follow the same element/evidence discipline and filing kits.
- Faster drafting: pre-wired sections, relief matrices, and exhibit discipline reduce revision cycles.
- Appellate-proofing: preservation tables and record cites built in from day one.
- Training value: LC teaches the why; FG standardizes the how, so work product looks “court-ready” on the first pass.

# **5) Mini-templates you can copy/paste today**

A) Claim → Element → Proof Table

Claim: ______________________ (Statute/Tort/Constitutional)

| Element | Facts to Prove | Exhibit/Source | Where in Record |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E1 |  | Ex. A, ¶2 | pg/¶ |
| E2 |  | Ex. B (decl.) | pg/¶ |
| E3 |  | Ex. C (email) | pg/¶ |
| Relief sought: _____________________ (tailored to harm & posture) |  |  |  |

B) Procedural Timeline & Deadline Grid

# **6) Typical failure modes the framework prevents**

- Conclusory pleading with no element-by-element proof.
- Exhibits that “exist” but don’t prove anything.
- Missed or mis-calendared deadlines (service, motions, appeals).
- Asking for relief that the record doesn’t support (or isn’t tailored).
- Losing issues on appeal because they weren’t preserved in the record.

# **7) Where to start (fast path)**

- LC Modules 1–5 to learn the core habits;
- Open FG cards for service, exhibits, and relief while you draft;
- Produce three artifacts in one sitting: (1) Element/Proof table, (2) Exhibit index with purpose tags, (3) Procedural grid.
Everything else flows from those three.
