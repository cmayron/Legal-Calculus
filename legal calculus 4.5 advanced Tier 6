Module 61 – Own the Calendar: Procedural Sovereignty Starts with Time 🗓️⏱️
⚖️ Core Message
If you don’t own the calendar, the calendar owns you. Procedural sovereignty begins with date math, buffers, and recurring checks that prevent preventable loss.

📖 Lesson Content
• Two-Clock Rule — Court deadlines and your internal 'T‑3/T‑1/T‑0' buffers.
• Recurring Review — Weekly docket check; monthly status memo; pre‑hearing kit cycle.
• Holiday Drift — Account for weekends/holidays; local rule nuances for cut‑offs.
• Automation — Calendar invites; reminders; colored labels by remedy type.
• Record It — File short Notices of Calculated Deadlines when helpful (for clarity).
📝 Assignment
Build a 90‑day calendar with T‑3/T‑1/T‑0 buffers for three known deadlines; add a weekly 'docket sweep' and a monthly 'status memo' event.

✅ Model Answer (Template)
DEADLINE PLAN (EXCERPT)
Opposition due 09/20 → T‑3 draft 09/13 → T‑1 proof 09/19 → T‑0 file 09/20 4:00pm.

💡 Reflection
Buffers turn urgency into rhythm; rhythm turns stress into habit.

• Cadence Board — Kanban lanes: Draft → Proof → File → Follow‑up → Archive.
• Friday Rule — If in doubt, place one brick by end of week; build momentum.
• Revisit — Convert clerk emails to Notices; convert refusals to Requests for Order.
• Archive Echo — Publish summary + hash after each brick to grow coalition.
📝 Assignment
Implement a 4‑week cadence board and commit to one filed page per week (Decision Cover + Order A/B).
