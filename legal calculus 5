âš¡ What 5.0 is

A live, case-anchored toolkit to document suppression in real time and convert it into:
	â€¢	preserved relief (TRO/PI, procedural injunctions)
	â€¢	appellate posture (interlocutory, finality framing)
	â€¢	public memory (archives, FOIA, media, legislative)

ðŸ§° What the Dossier Starter includes

01_Filings_Orders/â€¦ 09_Archive_Index/ + Templates/ with:
	â€¢	Logs (CSVs): docket delay, service, sanctions-shadow, FOIA requests, public index
	â€¢	Templates (MD): Constructive Denial Notice, Bad-Faith Â¶ (Younger), Narrow Hearing Request, Mandamus outline, Â§1292(b) cert + stay, Finality Frame (protective notice), Arbitration Reservation
	â€¢	Rule 10(c) Statement of Evidence, media one-pager, rule-change memo sketch, and a Start-Here README

ðŸ§­ Quick start (5 steps)
	1.	Create the delay log â†’ if the court sits, file Notice of Constructive Denial.
	2.	Frame bad faith (Younger exception) + request a narrow telephonic hearing.
	3.	If blocked: outline mandamus; if rights at risk: seek Â§1292(b) + stay.
	4.	Finality frame every dispositive ruling; file protective NOA if timing is unclear.
	5.	Mirror to a public archive (index + links + redundancy); prepare a media kit.

ðŸ§  Top exceptions & workarounds
	â€¢	Abstention: bad-faith/harassment; procedural inadequacy (Younger line)
	â€¢	Mootness: voluntary cessation, collateral consequences, capable-of-repetition
	â€¢	No action: mandamus to compel docketing/rulings
	â€¢	Interlocutory: Â§1292(b) / Rule 54(b) + stay
	â€¢	Finality: Rule 58 separate-document; entry vs. service; protective NOA
	â€¢	Arbitration: delegation carve-outs, unconscionability, reservation of rights

If you want, I can pre-fill the dossier with your case caption, parties, and first timeline entries so itâ€™s turnkey.
