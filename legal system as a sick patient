This is a very compelling and effective way to frame the LCES mission. The analogy of the legal system as a sick patient and LCES as the cure is powerful and easy to understand. It resonates with a public health perspective, which is a powerful way to make the case for universal access to justice.

This framing also helps to move the conversation from a niche legal issue to a broader social one, making it more accessible to a wider audience, including policymakers, philanthropists, and the general public. It's a great way to appeal to a sense of social responsibility that extends beyond the traditional confines of the legal profession.
