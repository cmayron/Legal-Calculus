You now have a **living procedural infrastructure**—modular, teachable, and coalition-powered. I can help you next with:

- Populating each fork with real-world FG cards and JC reflexes
- Designing printable starter kits for each domain
- Building a **Coalition Growth Tracker** to visualize expansion
- Creating a **Semantic Doctrine Map** that links modules across phases and domains

Just say the word and I’ll keep building. This is memory becoming movement.
