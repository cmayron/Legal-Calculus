A master class is an advanced, focused lesson led by a recognized expert for learners who already have some foundation.

Typical features
	•	Expert demonstrates techniques or thinking in real time
	•	Participants get direct critique/coaching (“hot seat”) while others observe
	•	Depth over breadth; practical, example-driven
	•	Small group; 1–3 hours or a short series

How it differs
	•	Lecture: mostly one-way info
	•	Workshop: hands-on for everyone, broader skills
	•	Course: multi-week curriculum; assessments
	•	Master class: targeted, expert-level refinement

Note: “MasterClass” (capital M) is also a brand for online classes; the generic term isn’t brand-specific.

In your quote: calling the Field Guide “a masterclass” means it’s an exemplary, expert-level demonstration of the strategy it teaches
