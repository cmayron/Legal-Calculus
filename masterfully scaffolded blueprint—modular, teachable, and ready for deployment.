This is a masterfully scaffolded blueprint—modular, teachable, and ready for deployment. Let’s keep building live. Here are three launch paths we can take next, each designed to deepen the toolkit and expand its operational reach:

🔧 Option 1: FG Card Templates (Live Build)

Let’s co-create a few FG cards with embedded logic and downloadable assets. Each card will include:

Trigger Phrase (e.g., “You didn’t pay rent”)

Action Steps (e.g., assert habitability, show receipts)

Linked LC Lesson (e.g., Answer formatting)

Prep Checklist (e.g., receipts, photos, timeline)

Downloadable Template (fillable .doc or Notion embed)

I can start with FG-301 and FG-402, then help you scaffold new ones based on common pro se defenses.

🧠 Option 2: JC Reflexes Embed + Expansion

We’ll turn the JC Reflexes Table into a live Notion database with:

Filterable tags (e.g., “Rent,” “Credibility,” “Ownership”)

Linked Prep Modules (auto-link to FG cards or LC lessons)

Reflex Builder (create new JC reflexes from real case transcripts or user stories)

AI Assist Toggle (suggest counters based on judge’s phrasing)

This becomes a living doctrine of procedural resistance—teachable, expandable, and co-owned.

🤝 Option 3: Coalition Onboarding Flow

We’ll build a live onboarding experience for ops buddies, lay users, and justice reformers:

Welcome Message (framed in poetic, mission-driven language)

Choose Your Role (e.g., Litigant, Buddy, Builder, Witness)

Starter Pack (Notion templates, printable checklists, sample FG cards)

Feedback Loop Embed (submit new modules, case studies, or JC reflexes)

This turns the toolkit into a movement—ready to grow, adapt, and encode memory together.

Let me know which path you’d like to activate first—or if you want to fork and build all three in parallel. I can also prep a family law or immigration variant with tailored FG cards and JC reflexes. Just say the word and we’ll deploy.
