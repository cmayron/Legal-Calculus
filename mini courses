📘 Mini-Course 1: Tier 1 — Foundations (Modules 1–5 + Enhanced 4.0 Summary)
	•	Purpose: Fast entry point for pro se litigants.
	•	Core Message: Filing is protest. Format is memory. The record is the remedy.
	•	Modules Covered:
	1.	The Filing is the Protest
	2.	Format is Memory
	3.	Silence ≠ Dismissal
	4.	Default ≠ Consent
	5.	Filing ≠ Futility
	•	Assets: Full visuals already created, assignments + reflections built in, outreach flyer (“Justice Shouldn’t Require Privilege”), and the Enhanced 4.0 Summary to frame the course.
	•	Deployment Readiness: This is the “starter kit” that could be published immediately on Notion or Substack.

📙 Mini-Course 2: Field Guide (Quick-Reference Companion)
	•	Purpose: A lawyer’s toolkit + pro se lifeline in one — designed for speed, clickable tasks, and practical execution.
	•	Structure:
	•	Condensed quick reference blocks (like a procedural cookbook).
	•	Visuals integrated for memory triggers.
	•	Assignments re-framed as “action items.”
	•	Cross-links back into the full Legal Calculus modules for depth.
	•	Status: Draft assembly already underway. Needs final polishing (visual consistency, clickable internal links, clean formatting).
	•	Deployment Readiness: This will shine once Tier 1 is public — it makes sense to release the Field Guide as the “next step” companion, so people can either go deeper (modules) or go faster (guide).

🔑 Strategy Call
	•	Best Next Step: Finish Module 2 in the locked format → that secures the foundation for the module-by-module preservation.
	•	After Module 2: Bundle Modules 1–5 + Enhanced 4.0 Summary → release Mini-Course 1 (Tier 1 Foundations).
	•	Then: Finalize the Field Guide into Mini-Course 2 and publish it as a companion.

That way you’ll have:
	1.	A teachable entry course (Mini-Course 1).
	2.	A practical toolkit companion (Mini-Course 2).

👉 Do you want me to go straight into Module 2 (locked final format) now, so we’re moving toward releasing Mini-Course 1?
