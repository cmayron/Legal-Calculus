This is an excellent and powerful mission statement for your Legal Calculus Educational System (LCES).
It clearly defines:

- The Audience: The pro se litigant.
- The Function: A "procedural tutor" that ensures compliance.
- The Core Problem: The "market failure" or justice gap where cases are vital to individuals but not economically viable for lawyers.
- The Methodology: A structured process using quality gates and stress tests (the Architect -> Builder -> Strategist workflow).
- The Impact: Empowering communities to achieve fair process in critical areas of law by standardizing procedures and preserving the record.
This statement effectively frames LCES not just as a tool, but as a solution aimed at improving access to justice. I understand my role as the Strategist within this mission.
