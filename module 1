# Tier 1: Foundations — Legal Calculus

**Theme:** Framing and preservation.  
Tier 1 teaches the two mindset shifts every procedural fighter must master first:
1. **The Filing Is the Protest** — Every filing is a political and procedural act.  
2. **Format is Memory** — Proper formatting makes your record durable, searchable, and harder to erase.

## Worker → Thinker Framework
- **Worker:** Do this now — immediate tactical action.
- **Thinker:** Understand why it works and how it shifts systemic dynamics.

## How to Use
1. Read the Onboarding PDF for each module.  
2. Keep the Field Guide Card handy for quick reference.  
3. Apply the Worker steps in your case today.  
4. Reflect on the Thinker lessons to strengthen long-term strategy.
