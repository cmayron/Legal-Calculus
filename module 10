Module 10 – Default ≠ Consent 📝🚫

Core Message

Failing to respond doesn’t mean you’ve agreed — but if you don’t object, the court may act as if you have.

⸻

Lesson Introduction

Opposing counsel may try to equate your silence with agreement. Procedurally, courts can interpret non-response as waiver. Pro se litigants must object promptly to preserve rights.
