Module 11 – Volume ≠ Vexatious 📚🔍

Core Message

Multiple filings aren’t inherently vexatious — if each serves a legitimate procedural purpose.

⸻

Lesson Introduction

Courts sometimes accuse pro se litigants of “flooding the docket.” The key is ensuring each filing is justified, targeted, and clearly connected to procedural necessity.

⸻

Teaching Block

1. Quality Over Quantity
	•	Every filing should add a distinct fact, law, or request.

2. Document the Purpose
	•	Explain why each filing was necessary at that time.

3. Anticipate the Label
	•	Include a note in major filings summarizing prior related submissions.
