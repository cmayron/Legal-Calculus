Module 12 – Refiling ≠ Redundancy 🔄📄

Core Message

Refiling a motion can be a strategic necessity, not a waste of the court’s time.

⸻

Lesson Introduction

Sometimes a motion is denied without prejudice, lost in docket delay, or never ruled on. Refiling ensures the issue remains active. For pro se litigants, it can also cure procedural defects.

⸻

Teaching Block

1. Watch for Procedural Denials
	•	Denial “without prejudice” means you can try again.

2. Cure and Refile
	•	Fix the defect and resubmit promptly.

3. Preserve the Timeline
	•	Refiling keeps the request within relevant deadlines for appeal.
