Module 13 – Table of Authorities = Table of Power 📑⚡

Core Message

Your Table of Authorities (TOA) isn’t just a formality — it’s the road map that tells the court where to find your strongest legal weapons.

⸻

Lesson Introduction

A well-structured TOA can make your argument more persuasive before the judge even reads a word of your brief. For a pro se litigant, it is also a credibility signal — showing that your filing is organized, rule-compliant, and built on actual precedent.

Teaching Block

1. The TOA as First Impression
	•	Judges often glance at the TOA to gauge substance before reading the motion.
	•	Strong, relevant cases at the top frame the whole argument.

2. Strategic Case Placement
	•	Group by weight: controlling precedent first, persuasive authority second.
	•	Highlight jurisdictional relevance.

3. Procedural Compliance
	•	Check your jurisdiction’s rules for TOA format and citations.
	•	Use consistent citation style (e.g., Bluebook, ALWD).

Real-World Illustration

In the Arizona arbitration challenge, leading with Wagenseller and Santana in the TOA made it harder for the court to dismiss them as irrelevant — even though they ultimately avoided addressing them.
