Module 14 – Captions Are Command Signals 🏛️📢

Core Message

A court filing’s caption isn’t decoration — it’s the filing’s identity. If it’s wrong, your filing can be rejected, misfiled, or ignored.

⸻

Lesson Introduction

The caption tells the clerk’s office where your filing belongs, who it applies to, and how it fits into the case. For a pro se litigant, getting the caption exactly right avoids procedural traps and ensures the filing enters the record correctly.

Teaching Block

1. Match the Court’s Format
	•	Copy the case name, number, and court title exactly as it appears on the docket.
	•	Include designations like “Plaintiff,” “Defendant,” and “In Official Capacity” accurately.

2. Signal Procedural Posture
	•	“Amended Complaint,” “Supplemental Brief,” or “Motion to Compel” should be clear in the title line.
	•	This tells the court how to process and index it.

3. Avoid Accidental Party Changes
	•	Misstating parties in the caption can alter legal posture — or suggest you’ve dropped or added parties unintentionally.
