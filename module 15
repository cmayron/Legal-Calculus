Module 15 ‚Äì Certificates of Service Are Shields üì¨üõ°Ô∏è

Core Message

Your Certificate of Service (COS) is your proof that the other side was given what you filed ‚Äî and it can be your defense against claims of unfair surprise.

‚∏ª

Lesson Introduction

Courts require that every filing be served on the opposing party. The COS is your sworn statement that you did so, and without it, your motion can be rejected.
