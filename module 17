Module 17 – The Relief Clause Is the Finish Line 🏁📜

Core Message

Your relief clause is where the court decides what it can give you. It must be precise, procedural, and complete.

⸻

Lesson Introduction

The relief clause is the “ask” at the end of your motion. Without it, the court can’t grant what you want — and may not guess.

⸻

Teaching Block

1. Be Specific
	•	Name the exact order you want.

2. Match the Motion Type
	•	TROs need immediate action; declaratory judgments define rights; injunctions stop conduct.

3. Preserve for Appeal
	•	An unclear relief clause may be deemed waived.
