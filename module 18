Module 18 – Procedural Posture = Procedural Leverage 🔄⚖️

Core Message

Your procedural posture defines what moves you can make next — and which ones are barred.

⸻

Lesson Introduction

Posture is where your case stands in the life cycle: pre-trial, trial, appeal, post-judgment. It dictates what filings are possible and persuasive.

⸻

Teaching Block

1. Identify the Stage
	•	Early: motions to dismiss or compel.
	•	Mid: discovery, summary judgment.
	•	Late: appeal, enforcement.

2. Leverage Posture
	•	Choose filings that fit the stage to avoid dismissal as “premature” or “moot.”

3. Use It Strategically
	•	Frame filings as necessary for the current posture to prevent procedural rejection.
