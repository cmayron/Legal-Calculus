A strong index in your filing helps the judge find what you want them to see — fast.

Lesson Introduction

Judges are busy. The index is your way of guiding them to your best points without them having to hunt.

Teaching Block

1. Make It Complete
	•	List all sections, exhibits, and appendices.

2. Use Descriptive Titles
	•	“Exhibit B – July 14, 2025 Court Order” instead of just “Exhibit B.”

3. Match Page Numbers Exactly
	•	Page errors break the utility of the index.
