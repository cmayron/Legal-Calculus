Module 21 ‚Äì Filing Before They Move the Goalposts üèàüìÑ

Core Message

Courts and opposing parties can change procedural rules mid-case. Filing early can lock in your rights before the goalposts move.

‚∏ª

Lesson Introduction

Legal timelines are not always static. Emergency orders, local rule changes, or sudden reclassification can shift the standard you must meet. For pro se litigants, filing sooner rather than later can prevent the application of harsher rules.

	‚Ä¢	If you hear hints of new rules or procedural shifts, file immediately.
