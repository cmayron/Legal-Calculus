Module 22 – The Motion Stack: Layering for Leverage 📚⚖️

Core Message

Stacking motions strategically can create multiple points of pressure, forcing the court to address your position.

⸻

Lesson Introduction

Courts often avoid ruling on a single motion that could resolve a case in your favor. A stack of motions — each with different grounds — makes avoidance harder.

⸻

Teaching Block

1. Layer Grounds
	•	Use procedural, substantive, and evidentiary motions together.

2. Keep Each Independent
	•	Even if one motion fails, others can still succeed.

3. Time for Maximum Impact
	•	File in a sequence that forces responses before key deadlines.

⸻

Real-World Illustration

In TRO practice, stacking a motion for preliminary injunction and a motion to expedite forced the court to address timing.
