Module 25 – Preemptive Relief Clauses 🎯📜

Core Message

Including relief clauses in filings that aren’t motions can preserve remedies before you formally request them.

Lesson Introduction

Some relief must be requested early to preserve rights. Embedding relief clauses in pleadings, notices, or supplemental briefs can keep the door open.
