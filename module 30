Module 30 – Stacking Legal Doctrines After Suppression 🏗️⚖️

Core Message

If one doctrine doesn’t open the door, stack multiple — jurisdictional, constitutional, statutory — to force the court to engage.

⸻

Lesson Introduction

Courts sometimes sidestep a single legal argument. Presenting multiple doctrines makes it harder to avoid addressing the merits.

⸻

Teaching Block

1. Combine Layers

	•	Judges must reconcile overlapping doctrines in their ruling.

3. Preserve on Multiple Fronts
	•	Increases appellate survival rate.
