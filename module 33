Module 33 – Non-Adversarial Format 🤝📄

Core Message

Not every filing must be framed as an attack; cooperative formats can achieve strategic goals.

⸻

Lesson Introduction

Some courts respond more favorably to neutral, information-sharing filings than to aggressive motions.

⸻

Teaching Block

1. Use Informational Tone
	•	“Notice” instead of “Motion” when possible.

2. Share Without Demanding
	•	Offer supplemental authority without pressing for immediate action.

3. Build Credibility
	•	Shows you’re procedural, not combative.
