Module 37 – Procedural Pattern Recognition 🔍📜

Core Message
Spotting repeated procedural tactics across cases can turn individual disadvantage into collective advantage.

Lesson Introduction
When you can identify patterns — the same delay tactic, the same type of misclassification, the same selective enforcement — you move from defending against isolated attacks to predicting them.

Teaching Block
	1.	Document Every Instance – Keep procedural logs.
	2.	Compare Across Cases – Your own and others’.
	3.	Turn Patterns into Proof – Use them in motions and public advocacy.

Real-World Illustration
Multiple TRO filings delayed in similar ways across unrelated cases showed systemic docket manipulation.

Assignment Prompt

Model Answer (Sample)
Pattern: Delaying docket entry of urgent filings. Purpose: To run out the clock on requested relief.

Reflection Summary
