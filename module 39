Module 39 – Discretion as Cover — When Integrity Becomes Immunity 🎭⚖️

Core Message
Judicial discretion can be used to shield procedural error instead of correcting it.

Lesson Introduction
“Discretion” allows a judge to choose between lawful options — but it can be stretched to excuse ignoring evidence.

Teaching Block
	1.	Spot Discretion Use – Look for language like “in the interest of justice” without factual basis.
	2.	Contrast with Law – Show when discretion conflicts with mandatory rules.
	3.	Preserve the Record – Make it clear you objected.

Real-World Illustration
A judge dismissed a motion without reviewing exhibits, citing “judicial efficiency” over fairness.

Assignment Prompt
Write one sentence objecting to improper use of discretion.

Model Answer (Sample)
“Respectfully, judicial discretion cannot override statutory requirements for evidentiary review.”

Reflection Summary
Integrity isn’t immunity from the law.
