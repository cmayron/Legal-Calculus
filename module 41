Module 43 – Procedural Forks and Forced Choices 🔀⚖️

Core Message
Courts sometimes frame your options so that either choice disadvantages you — but recognizing the fork lets you find a third path.

Lesson Introduction
Forced choices are used to funnel litigants into less favorable positions.

Teaching Block
	1.	Spot the Fork – “Proceed now and waive X” or “Wait and lose Y.”
	2.	Map Outcomes – Document consequences of each choice.
	3.	Create Option Three – Motion for hybrid relief or protective order.

Real-World Illustration
Being told to either dismiss an appeal or forfeit new evidence — instead, moving to supplement the record created a third option.

Assignment Prompt
Describe a forced choice and your “Option Three.”

Model Answer (Sample)
Forced choice: Settle or pay all costs to proceed. Option Three: Motion to waive costs based on indigence.

Reflection Summary
When framed into a corner, redraw the frame.

Visual Pairing
Concept: A fork in the road with a third hidden trail. Caption:
“The Best Option May Be the One They Didn’t Offer.”
