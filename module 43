odule 42 – Procedural Triage 🚑📄

Core Message
When multiple procedural emergencies arise, you must prioritize — some deadlines are more fatal than others.

Lesson Introduction
Like in medicine, triage in litigation means knowing what to address first to prevent total case collapse.

Teaching Block
	1.	Identify Drop-Dead Deadlines – TROs, appeals, statutory limits.
	2.	Stabilize First – Secure extensions if possible.
	3.	Defer Secondary Issues – Return once emergencies are controlled.

Real-World Illustration
In the OPMC case, immediate TRO filing took priority over less urgent discovery disputes.

Assignment Prompt

Model Answer (Sample)
	1.	Filing TRO before enforcement date.
	2.	Submitting appellate notice before deadline.
	3.	Serving defendants before service window closes.

Reflection Summary
