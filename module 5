Module 5 – Relief Requested = Relief Possible 🎯

Core Message

Courts can only give you what you ask for — and only in the form you ask for it. A filing without a clear, procedurally proper request is an argument without an ending.

⸻

Lesson Introduction

Relief is the legal term for what you want the court to do. If you don’t name it, the court won’t grant it. For pro se litigants, it’s easy to get lost in telling your story and forget to state the specific order you’re seeking.

Teaching Block

1. Name the Relief
	•	Always state the relief in clear, specific terms: “Plaintiff requests an order enjoining enforcement of…”
	•	Avoid vague asks like “any other relief the court deems just and proper” unless paired with a specific primary request.

2. Fit Relief to Procedure
	•	Temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, declaratory judgments — each has its own procedural requirements.
	•	Asking for the wrong procedural tool can sink your request.

3. Relief Shapes Review
	•	Appellate courts review the relief requested to determine whether it was preserved.
	•	No request = no preservation = no reversal.

Real-World Illustration

In the Arizona arbitration case, explicitly requesting both TRO and preliminary injunction allowed the filing to survive procedural challenges and ensured both forms of relief were preserved for appeal.

Write a one-sentence request for relief in:
	1.	A TRO motion.

Reflection Summary

If you don’t name your relief, you’ve left the court nothing to grant.
