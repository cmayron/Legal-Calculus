Module 54 – Procedural Injunctions 🚫⚖️

Core Message
Not all injunctions stop conduct — some stop procedural harm.

Lesson Introduction
Courts can enjoin procedural moves like enforcing arbitration or dismissing for forum reasons.

Teaching Block
	1.	Define the Procedural Harm – E.g., loss of appellate rights.
	2.	Show Irreparable Injury – Procedural loss can’t be fixed later.
	3.	Match Legal Standard – TRO/PI rules still apply.

Real-World Illustration
A preliminary injunction prevented arbitration from mooting appellate review.

Assignment Prompt
Name one procedural harm you could enjoin.

Model Answer (Sample)
Forcing a case into private arbitration before appeal is decided.

Reflection Summary
Procedure itself can be enjoined.
