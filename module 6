Module 6 ‚Äì The Pro Se Trap: Procedure as Pretext ü™§

Core Message

Courts sometimes apply procedural rules not to ensure fairness, but to create a pretext for denying pro se claims without addressing the merits. Recognizing this trap is the first step in resisting it.

‚∏ª

Lesson Introduction

The rules of procedure were designed to create order, but they can be weaponized. For pro se litigants, minor errors in captioning, service, or formatting are often magnified into fatal defects ‚Äî while similar errors by attorneys are brushed aside as harmless.

The pro se trap isn‚Äôt about the law being against you; it‚Äôs about the process being used to keep you out of it.

Teaching Block

1. The Rule as a Gate
	‚Ä¢	Clerks and judges can cite procedural noncompliance as grounds to refuse filing or deny relief.
	‚Ä¢	This can happen even if the same ‚Äúdefect‚Äù has been overlooked for represented parties.

2. Selective Enforcement
	‚Ä¢	Rules are sometimes applied more strictly to pro se filings to limit case volume or avoid complex cases.
	‚Ä¢	The record may show attorney filings with similar defects accepted without issue.

3. Turn the Rule into Evidence
	‚Ä¢	If your filing is rejected for a technical reason, document attorney filings accepted despite the same defect.
	‚Ä¢	Pattern evidence can become the basis for a denial-of-access claim.

Real-World Illustration

In the Arizona appellate misclassification, a procedural classification rule was selectively applied to reframe the appeal into a discretionary review ‚Äî a pretext for denial without a merits decision.

Reflection Summary

Procedural rules are neutral only in theory. In practice, they can be tactical weapons.
