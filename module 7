Module 7 – Framing Bad Faith: The Exception to Abstention 🚫⚖️

Core Message

You can pierce abstention doctrines like Younger when you can prove the other side — including a state agency or court — is acting in bad faith or to harass. But you must frame it in a way the court can’t ignore.

⸻

Lesson Introduction

Federal courts often decline to interfere with ongoing state proceedings under Younger abstention. But there’s a narrow exception: bad faith, harassment, or other extraordinary circumstances. For a pro se litigant, this means documenting not just the harm, but the motive and pattern of procedural abuse.

Teaching Block

1. Show It’s Not Neutral
	•	Identify procedural choices that serve no purpose except to block your claims.
	•	Demonstrate selective enforcement of rules or misstatements of fact by the opposing party or tribunal.

2. Make the Pattern Visible
	•	Present multiple instances of the same suppression tactic.
	•	Connect actions to timing that harms your position.

3. Tie to Doctrine
	•	Quote controlling cases (e.g., Cullen v. Fliegner, Schlagler v. Phillips) that accept bad faith as an exception to Younger.

Real-World Illustration

In the OPMC case, the hearing was accelerated only after the plaintiff filed whistleblower claims — a timeline that suggests retaliatory motive.

Assignment Prompt

Task:
Draft a short paragraph for a motion that identifies:
	1.	The action taken.
	2.	Why it serves no legitimate purpose.
	3.	How it fits the bad faith exception.

⸻

Model Answer (Sample)

“Respondents advanced the OPMC hearing date by six weeks only after Plaintiff filed federal claims alleging retaliation, a timing that serves no legitimate purpose other than to undermine federal review. This pattern fits the bad faith exception recognized in Cullen v. Fliegner.”

⸻

Reflection Summary

Abstention isn’t absolute — but breaking it requires more than complaining. You must prove motive.
