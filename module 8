ule 8 – Misclassification = Evasion 🗂️➡️🚪

Core Message

Reclassifying your case is a tactic to avoid reaching the merits. If you don’t fight the misclassification, you may never get a real ruling.

⸻

Lesson Introduction

Courts sometimes change the procedural posture of your case — from “appeal” to “special action,” from “civil” to “administrative” — to limit their obligations. For a pro se litigant, this change often shuts the door to meaningful review.

Teaching Block

1. Why They Do It
	•	Appeals can require full review; special actions are discretionary.
	•	Misclassification lets the court avoid setting precedent or addressing uncomfortable facts.

2. How to Spot It
	•	Look for orders re-labeling your filing.
	•	Compare the procedural rights available under each classification.

3. How to Fight It
	•	File a motion to correct classification immediately.
	•	Attach examples of similarly situated cases kept in the original posture.

Real-World Illustration

The Arizona appellate court’s July 14, 2025 order reclassifying the appeal to a special action eliminated the right to review and created a Catch-22.
