Module 85 – The Public Archive as Procedural Armor 📂🛡️

Core Message
Publishing your case record makes it harder for procedural injustice to disappear quietly.

Lesson Introduction
When filings live only in a court system, they can be buried, sealed, or removed. A public archive protects the record and invites external scrutiny.

Teaching Block
	1.	Publish Completely – Include filings, exhibits, transcripts.
	2.	Index Clearly – Make it navigable.
	3.	Share Widely – Build awareness beyond legal circles.

Real-World Illustration
A whistleblower’s filings were removed from PACER but preserved on an open public archive, later cited in advocacy campaigns.

Assignment Prompt
List two benefits of publishing your record publicly.

Model Answer (Sample)
	1.	Protects against record suppression.
	2.	Increases accountability through public access.

Reflection Summary
Public archives protect procedural truth.
