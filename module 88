Module 88 – Redundancy in Public Preservation 📦🔄

Core Message
Store your public archive in more than one place — and in more than one format.

Lesson Introduction
Like procedural redundancy in filings, archive redundancy prevents single-point failures.

Teaching Block
	1.	Use Multiple Platforms – GitHub, Internet Archive, personal site.
	2.	Keep Offline Copies – For when the internet fails.
	3.	Cross-Link – Make each archive point to the others.

Real-World Illustration
An advocacy group mirrored its court record archive across three platforms, surviving a takedown attempt.

Assignment Prompt
List two redundant archive strategies.

Model Answer (Sample)
	1.	PDF copies on multiple cloud services.
	2.	Physical media in separate locations.

Reflection Summary
One copy is vulnerable. Three copies endure.

Visual Pairing
Concept: Three safes labeled with different archive locations. Caption:
“Preserve Everywhere.”
