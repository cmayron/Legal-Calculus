Module 9 – Silence ≠ Settlement 🤐❌

Core Message

When a court or opposing party goes silent, it does not mean you’ve won — and it can mean they’re positioning to deny you later.

⸻

Lesson Introduction

In law, silence is rarely neutral. It may signal delay tactics, procedural deadlines being run out, or a decision being prepared against you. For a pro se litigant, interpreting silence correctly is critical.

Teaching Block

1. Silence as Delay
	•	Waiting out TRO or PI deadlines makes your request moot.

2. Silence as Strategy
	•	Opposing counsel may withhold filings to force you into procedural default.

3. Break the Silence
	•	File a “Request for Status” or “Notice of Supplemental Authority” to re-engage the court.
