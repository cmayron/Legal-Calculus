This diagram shows the **learning path**: Orientation → Core → Practice → Publishing → Contribution.

## 🎙 Guided Walkthroughs

- **Pinned Issue: “Start Here”** → A step-by-step checklist for new users.
- **Discussion Threads** → Act as classrooms where coalition members debate doctrine.
- **Voice Scripts** → Ritualized onboarding text that can be read aloud in coalition meetings.

---

## 📚 Modular Starter Packs

- **Orientation Pack** → cue cards, flowcharts, stress-management handouts.
- **Evidence Preservation Pack** → checklists, spoliation strategies, case studies.
- **Arbitration Bias Pack** → advocacy scripts, bias-mitigation guides.
- **Publishing Pack** → markdown templates for ceremonial doctrine.

---

## 🏛 Coalition Rituals

- **Onboarding Rite** → new contributors add their name to `/orientation/roll.md`.
- **Ceremonial Merge** → every PR merged adds a ritual entry in `/rituals/merge-log.md`.
- **Legacy Encoding** → provenance metadata (`forkwatch.json`) ensures contributions are traceable.

---

## 🌐 Access Channels

- **GitHub Wiki** → functions as the library.
- **Issues** → checkpoints for orientation tasks.
- **Discussions** → classrooms for doctrine refinement.
- **Actions** → publishing pipeline (`publish.yml`) ensures doctrine is formatted and released.

---

## 🚀 Copilot Integration

- **Prompt Templates**:
    - “Generate a checklist for arbitration bias.”
    - “Draft a README for coalition onboarding.”
    - “Create a markdown template for ceremonial publishing.”
- **Workflow Automation**: Copilot helps scaffold GitHub Actions for publishing doctrine.
- **Coalition Scripts**: Copilot drafts cue cards and flowcharts directly in markdown.

### ✅ Next Step

You now have:

- A **campus map** (ASCII diagram).
- A [**CONTRIBUTING.md**](http://contributing.md/) guide.
- A **workflow file** for publishing doctrine.
- A **multi-channel orientation strategy** (Issues, Wiki, Discussions, Rituals).

This makes the repo feel like a **living law school**, not just a code archive.

Would you like me to **draft the [README.md](http://readme.md/) front page** next, so visitors immediately see the vision and curriculum when they land on the Legal Calculus repo?
