EMAIL TEMPLATES â€“ PRESERVATION OF SERVICE AND NOTICE TO COURT


ðŸ“§ Email to Arizona Attorney General:

Subject: Notice Re: Lack of Formal Appearance and Record Preservation â€“ Mayron v. Touhill (2:25-cv-02480-PHX-SHD)

Dear Ms. Quinonez,

I am writing to confirm receipt of your August 9, 2025 email transmitting a courtesy copy of Defendantâ€™s Response to my Emergency Motion and related filings. As of this date, I have not received formal service of these filings by mail, nor have I seen a Notice of Appearance or responsive pleading filed in the docket by your office.

As you are aware, I served the Arizona Attorney Generalâ€™s Office by certified mail in compliance with Rule 4, and filed multiple procedural notices of that service (Docs. 33, 35, 36, 37), which were later stricken by the Court. To the extent any procedural defect is asserted regarding my filings, I respectfully preserve the record that your office had actual notice but has not made formal appearance.

Please confirm whether you intend to file a formal Notice of Appearance. This communication is being preserved for appeal.

Sincerely,  
Charles Mayron, MD, FACS

ðŸ“§ Email to Clerk of Court (or Pro Se Office):

Subject: Notice of Record Preservation Re: Service and Mailbox Rule â€“ Mayron v. Touhill (2:25-cv-02480-PHX-SHD)

Dear Clerk,

I am a pro se litigant in the above-captioned matter. I write to preserve the record regarding service and procedural compliance before the Court issues a final ruling.

Please note the following:
- I completed certified mail service on the Arizona Attorney General and filed multiple procedural notices (Docs. 33, 35, 36, 37)
- These were stricken from the record, despite good-faith compliance with Rule 4(l)
- I received informal email from the AGâ€™s office, but no formal appearance or service from them was filed
- I have attached the following for docketing or court review:
 â€¢ Notice of Preservation â€“ Service Compliance
 â€¢ Mailbox Rule Compliance Statement
 â€¢ Reply Declaration â€“ AG Email Discrepancy

These documents preserve the record under FRCP 46 and are intended to clarify that any alleged service failure arises from judicial suppression, not my own noncompliance.

Thank you for confirming receipt or forwarding to Judge Desaiâ€™s chambers.

Respectfully,  
Charles Mayron, MD, FACS
