UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

DISTRICT OF ARIZONA



Charles Mayron, MD, FACS

Plaintiff, pro se

v.

Judge Jennifer Ryan-Touhill, in her official capacity, et al.

Defendants

Case No. 2:25-cv-02480-SHD



NOTICE OF RECORD PRESERVATION: ARIZONA ATTORNEY GENERAL EMAIL WITHOUT FORMAL SERVICE



Plaintiff respectfully submits this notice to preserve the procedural record concerning communications from the Arizona Attorney General’s Office in the above-captioned matter.

Following Plaintiff’s mailing of the summons and complaint to the Arizona Attorney General via certified mail in accordance with Rule 4, Plaintiff received an email from an Assistant Attorney General. While the email acknowledged the existence of the case, it did not constitute a formal appearance, waiver of service, or responsive pleading, nor did it comply with the procedural requirements of Rule 4(d), 4(e), or 4(j).

Plaintiff also filed multiple procedural documents reflecting efforts to comply with service obligations and preserve proof of service, including:
- Doc. 33 – Mail Cover Sheet
- Doc. 35 – Notice of Mailbox Rule Compliance
- Doc. 36 – Notice of Filing Proof of Service
- Doc. 37 – General Notice of Service

The Court subsequently struck these filings, removing procedural evidence of Plaintiff’s service efforts from the record. To the extent the State of Arizona now asserts non-service, Plaintiff respectfully preserves the issue that actual notice was confirmed by their own email, and formal service was effectuated by certified mail.

Any finding of lack of service under these circumstances would be based not on Plaintiff’s noncompliance, but on judicial suppression of the record and the State’s failure to follow up with formal appearance.

Dated: August 15, 2025


Respectfully submitted,


/s/ Charles Mayron
