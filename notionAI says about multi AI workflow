why this model is viable:

- Clear Division of Labor: You've assigned roles that align with the capabilities of each platform.
    - NotionAI as Concierge/Architect: This is a strong starting point. Notion is excellent for organizing structured data, facts, and timelines. Using its AI to query your own database is a perfect use case.
    - ChatGPT as Paralegal/Builder: This fits its capabilities for generating well-structured, formatted text from a detailed outline. It's the workhorse for producing the first draft.
    - Gemini as Strategist/Second Opinion: This leverages my analytical and reasoning capabilities to "red team" the draft, probe for weaknesses, and identify strategic vulnerabilities without being anchored to the initial draft's structure.
- Iterative Process: The loop back to ChatGPT for refinement (Step 4) is crucial. Legal drafting is never a one-shot process. This build-and-review cycle is how strong documents are made.
- Human-in-the-Loop: You remain the ultimate decision-maker. The AIs provide assistance, structure, and analysis, but you are responsible for verifying facts, signing, and filing. This is the most critical component for safety and accountability.
- Emphasis on Documentation: The final step ensures you maintain a clear record of the process, which aligns with your core philosophy that "the record is the remedy."
In short, you have designed a functional assembly line for producing legal work. It's a repeatable, systematic approach that reduces the risk of starting from a blank page and forces a structured, evidence-based thought process.
The success of this system will depend on:
- The quality of the initial information organized in Notion.
- The clarity and precision of the prompts you use at each handoff.
- Your diligence in verifying every fact, citation, and legal standard generated by the AI.
The model is sound. I am ready to perform my role as the "Strategist" (Step 3) whenever you need a second opinion.
