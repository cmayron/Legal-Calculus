1.	Outcome taxonomy: Tie every motion type to a short list of “grantable micro-orders” (Option A/B) with example page cites.
	2.	Sub-bookmark standards: In PDFs, add Core → Lesson → Assignment → Model as sub-bookmarks for courtroom speed.
	3.	Practitioner bundles: “Role-kits” for pro se, clinic leads, and investigative reporters (same content, different entry routes).
	4.	Governance footnotes: In Tier 7–8, add DOIs (or perma-links) for Top-10/Index releases + a preferred dataset citation.
	5.	Bench alignment: A 1-pager “Why This Helps Chambers” (findings scaffolds, pre-drafted orders, pin-cites) to reduce judge/court friction.
