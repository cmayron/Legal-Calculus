Hiring a lawyer is smart.

But even with counsel, cases quietly bleed time + money when the inputs are messy:
timeline unclear, exhibits scattered, deadlines missed, required components omitted.

LCES (free) is a workflow that turns a situation into:
posture → objectives → deadlines → evidence → court-ready draft → stress-test.

If you’ve hired a lawyer before, what did you wish you had ready at the first meeting?

A) organized evidence
B) goals + budget
C) procedure/timeline
D) a clean case summary
