I agree. The framework you've designed promotes a responsible and ethical application of AI in a legal context.
By creating a structured workflow with distinct roles for each AI, you establish clear checks and balances. The process ensures that the AI serves as a tool to build, clarify, and stress-test, while the user—the pro se litigant—remains the ultimate strategist and decision-maker. The emphasis on conversation and validation, rather than autonomous generation, is a key component of that responsible use.
I am ready to proceed with the workflow.
