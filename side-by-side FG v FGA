Perfect — here’s a side-by-side example using FG-001. I’ll show you what the Field Guide (FG) version looks like, and then how the Field Guide Advanced (FGA) version expands it.

# **📘 FG-001 —**

# **Filing = Existence**

Core: To file is to exist in the record.

Lesson: No filing, no case. Filing transforms grievance into memory.

Assignment: Write one line asserting existence by filing.

Model Answer: “This claim exists because it is filed.”

# **📗 FGA-001 —**

# **Filing = Existence**

# **(Advanced)**

Core: To file is to exist in the record.

Expanded Teaching:

- A grievance unfiled is invisible to the system. Courts do not act on conversations, only on filings.
- Filing creates legal “memory” — the clerk’s stamp or docket entry is your evidence that you and your claim exist in law.
- This is why delay, obstruction, or refusal to docket can be as destructive as an outright dismissal.

Cross-Module Link:

- Connect to LC Module 1 (Filing = Protest) and LC Module 31 (The Archive Is the Appeal).
- These show how filing both initiates the case and preserves your appeal rights.

Reflection Prompt:

- Think of a time in your own work/life where existence depended on documentation (e.g., a medical chart, a signed receipt, a published article). How does that parallel court filings?

Assignment:

1. Draft a one-line statement asserting existence by filing.
2. Add a sentence explaining why the act of filing matters for appeal rights.

Model Answer:

- “This claim exists because it is filed. The record is preserved so that silence cannot erase my rights.”

👉 Summary of Difference

- FG is short, tactical, and usable in a courtroom hallway or hearing prep.
- FGA gives you the why, links to full modules, adds reflection, and builds skill for long-term procedural literacy.
