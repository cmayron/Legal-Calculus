This is a highly structured and professional onboarding path. By treating the Legal Calculus Educational System (LCES) as a standard software engineering project, you are ensuring that any legal work produced is not only modular but also verifiable through a "chain of custody" (provenance).
Below is a breakdown of how these steps solidify the Architect-Builder-Inspector workflow and a few suggestions to harden the pipeline.
Phase 1: Environment & Infrastructure
The focus here is on the "Local Dev" experience, ensuring contributors don't break the existing modular logic.

- Step 1 & 2 (Fork/Smoke Test): This establishes the developer’s "sandbox."
- Step 3 (Metadata & Provenance): This is the most critical step for legal integrity. By implementing a Notion → GitHub provenance block, you are creating a digital "fingerprint" of where a legal argument originated and how it evolved.
    - Suggestion: The forkwatch.json should likely track the version of the "Inspector" logic used at the time of the commit to ensure retrospective audits are possible.
    Phase 2: Automation & Intelligence
    This phase transforms a static repository into an active "Legal Factory."
- Step 4 (CI/GitHub Action): Automating the published/ directory prevents manual errors.
- Step 5 (Inspector Prototypes): This is where the Three-AI Architecture comes to life.
    - Formatting Checks: Ensure the Markdown matches court-specific styles (e.g., specific margins or font-weight simulation).
    - Citation Patterns: An automated check that flags missing "id." or "supra" references can save a pro se litigant from significant procedural errors.
    Phase 3: Documentation & Submission
- Step 6 (API Documentation): Since LCES relies on specific Architect/Builder/Inspector roles, the [developer.md](http://developer.md/) needs to define the "hand-off" points. For example: How does the Architect output feed into the Builder prompt?
- Step 7 (The Intent Declaration): In a legal context, the "Intent Declaration" in a PR acts like an affidavit of work, aligning perfectly with the LCES philosophy of transparency.
Suggested Enhancements for the "Inspector" Logic
To make the Inspector checks even more robust for contributors, you might consider adding these to Step 5:
| Check Type | Logic | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Dead Link Check | Scans all [Source] links in the Markdown. | Ensures all evidence or exhibits cited are still accessible. |
| Schema Validation | Validates the JSON front-matter against forkwatch.json. | Prevents "dirty" data from entering the published record. |
| Logic Flagging | Searches for "Placeholder" text (e.g., [Insert Date]). | Prevents the submission of incomplete legal documents. |
Next Step
This roadmap is ready for execution. Would you like me to draft the initial content for [developer.md](http://developer.md/) or help you define the JSON schema for forkwatch.json to ensure it captures all necessary provenance data?
