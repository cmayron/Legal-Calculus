Perfect — let’s set up a **starter workflow file** for the Legal Calculus GitHub repo so doctrine contributions can be automatically formatted and published. This will give coalition members a clear, repeatable path for submitting and maintaining modules.

---

## ⚙️ Workflow File: `.github/workflows/publish.yml`

```yaml
name: Publish Doctrine

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run formatting checks
        run: npm run format

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Publish artifacts
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: |
          mkdir -p public
          cp -r doctrine/* public/
          echo "Doctrine published at $(date)" > public/README.md

      - name: Upload artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: doctrine
          path: public
```

### 🔑 What This Workflow Does
- **Checks out the repo** → ensures the latest code is available.  
- **Sets up Node.js** → useful if modules rely on JavaScript tooling.  
- **Runs formatting/tests** → keeps doctrine contributions consistent and validated.  
- **Publishes artifacts** → copies doctrine files into a `public/` folder for coalition use.  
- **Uploads artifacts** → makes them available for download from the Actions tab.

### 🚀 How to Use
1. Create a `.github/workflows/publish.yml` file in your repo.  
2. Paste the workflow above.  
3. Commit and push to `main`.  
4. Every push or pull request will now trigger formatting, testing, and publishing.

Would you like me to also **draft a `CONTRIBUTING.md` guide** so coalition members know exactly how to fork, edit, and submit doctrine modules into the People’s Law School?
