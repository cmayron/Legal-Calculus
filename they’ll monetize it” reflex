Incumbents protect billables and brand reputation. The solution: make Legal Calculus (LC) mission-locked, evidence-driven, and revenue-neutral—easier to adopt than to resist.

# **Disarm the “they’ll monetize it” reflex**

- Position LC as a standard, not a competitor.
“LC is a public procedural standard + teaching kit; firms can layer services on top.” (Standards don’t kill revenue; they create it.)
- Human-in-the-loop by design.
Checklists that require attorney/clinic sign-off reduce UPL fears and malpractice anxiety.
- Outcome first, features second.
Lead with time saved, error reductions, and docket wins—metrics are harder to dismiss than ideology.

# **Lock the mission (so capture is costly)**

- Licensing triad:
    - Content: CC BY 4.0
    - Code/tools: AGPL-3.0 (forces improvements to remain open if hosted)
    - Data schemas: CC0 (encourages ecosystem adoption)
- 
- Governance: a short “Public Interest Charter” (purpose, non-discrimination, no paywalls for individuals/legal aid, transparent roadmap).
- Trademark “Legal Calculus.” Lets you stop predatory forks that add paywalls.

# **Route around gatekeepers**

- Clinics/legal-aid pilots (4–6 weeks): you provide curriculum + forms; they provide outcomes + testimonial.
- Court-adjacent audiences: self-help centers, librarians, community colleges—less captured, highly motivated.
- Judicially friendly packaging: bench memos, neutral checklists, and model orders—this reads as help, not heresy.

# **Proof loops that travel**

- Pilot Report (4 pages): problem → LC modules used → before/after metrics → quotes.
- DOI-backed release: mint a versioned public release with a “How to cite” block.
- Micro-demos (≤5 min): one task each (e.g., “From denial to motion to reconsider in 3 steps”).

# **Objection→Answer cheat sheet**

- “AI is risky.” → LC uses primary-source PDFs + pin-cite enforcement; every quote is auditable.
- “This replaces lawyers.” → LC amplifies supervision and trains juniors; it’s a procedural standard, not legal advice.
- “Open = low quality.” → Show pilot metrics + judge-preferred formats (issues charts, element tables, model orders).

# **Sustainable models that aren’t extractive**

- Free for individuals/legal aid; paid institutional support (training, integrations, hosted search).
- Funder-friendly menu: pilots, impact dashboards, and a public roadmap keyed to grants/donors.

# **7-day sprint (concrete)**

1. Publish a Mission-Locked License & Charter (1 page).
2. Ship a v1 Pilot Kit (syllabus, assignments, evaluation rubric).
3. Record two micro-demos.
4. Stand up a metrics page (three KPIs you can update monthly).
5. Email five clinic directors with the invite below.

Pilot invite (paste-ready):

“Subject: 4-week pilot to reduce filing errors for pro se litigants

Hi [Name]—I’m piloting Legal Calculus, a free procedural standard + teaching kit. We’ll run a 4-week, light-lift pilot: (1) baseline 2–3 tasks your students already do; (2) LC modules/checklists; (3) before/after error/time metrics; (4) a short joint summary. No cost; all materials public. If helpful, I’ll handle setup and weekly office hours. Interested in picking two dates?”

# **Next moves**

- Launch the pilot kit and charter this week—speed signals seriousness.
- Track one metric obsessively: time-to-competent-draft (before/after LC).
- Publish one "win story" per month: case outcome, time saved, or adoption metric—makes LC real and spreadable.
- Build a "judge toolkit": model orders, element checklists, and citation standards that courts can adopt without controversy.
