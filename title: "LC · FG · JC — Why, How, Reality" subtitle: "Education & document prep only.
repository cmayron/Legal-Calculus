### The Triad

- **LC — Legal Calculus (Why):** Purpose, principles, and *why* the record matters. “Filing is protest. Format is memory. The record is the remedy.”
- **FG — Field Guide (How):** Checklists, captions, certificates of service, exhibit indexing, page limits — the *how* of compliant filing.
- **JC — Judicial Calculus (Reality):** Practical constraints and clerk/judge reflex patterns — the *reality* you’ll face.

### Workflow (UPL‑safe)

**User Narrative → Architect (Notion AI) → Blueprint JSON → Builder (ChatGPT, paralegal‑like, non‑interactive) → Strategist (Compliance stress‑test) → Filing**

- **Architect:** Educational scaffolding only. Normalizes facts into a schema; does **not** choose arguments.
- **Builder:** Non‑interactive **document assembler**; **not** a lawyer. Formats from the Blueprint.
- **Strategist:** **Compliance activity**, not legal advice — stress‑tests the procedural build for completeness, consistency, and procedural fit.

### Start Here

1. **Orientation:** LC = Why · FG = How · JC = Reality
2. **Blueprint Intake:** Convert your factual narrative into a Blueprint JSON.
3. **Assemble:** Generate captions, exhibit index, certificates of service, and a filing‑ready package.
4. **Compliance Check:** Run the Strategist checklist before you file.
