# Legal Calculus — Public Infrastructure for Procedural Justice

> **Filing is protest. Format is memory. The record is the remedy.**

Legal Calculus is an **open, modular framework** for making the law navigable, building collective procedural memory, and transforming resistance into record.  
It connects **immediate, tactical needs** to **strategic, systemic understanding** through the **Worker → Thinker** model.

## What is Legal Calculus?

Most legal systems are designed to be **opaque** and **selective** — accessible mainly to credentialed insiders.  
Legal Calculus dismantles that by providing:

- **Procedural navigation tools** anyone can use.
- **A shared archive** of systemic patterns and procedural failures.
- **A platform for collaboration** across pro se users, educators, and advocacy groups.

## The Worker → Thinker Framework

| **Worker** | **Thinker** |
|------------|-------------|
| Immediate, task-focused procedural action. | Strategic, systemic understanding of why that task matters. |
| Example: File a Procedural Objection ⚡ | Example: Teaching Preservation Strategy |

Every module pairs a **Worker checklist** with a **Thinker lesson**.  
This ensures **short-term survival** in a case is always connected to **long-term structural change**.
