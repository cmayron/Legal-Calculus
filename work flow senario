Workflow Mapping the Legal Calculus Pyramid

Scenario 1: Filing a TRO (Pro Se Litigant)

FG-1000 (Base):

Quick checklist: FG-47 — TRO Filing Steps

Model “Notice of TRO” form

Reminder of mailbox rule deadlines

LC Modules 1–119 (Middle):

Module 20 — Winter Standard (teaches four-part TRO test)

Module 24 — The Pro Se Trap (anticipates procedural denial tactics)

Assignments for drafting arguments → self-check against model answer

Master FG v1.0 (Top):

Preserves the TRO philosophy, rationale, and past reflections for the archive

Provides full teaching examples for educators analyzing TRO process

Scenario 2: Preparing for Oral Argument (Litigant + Educator)

FG-1000 (Base):

FG-310 — Oral Argument Prep Checklist

Quick cue cards on rebuttal strategy

Timing management tools (who speaks first, when to interject)

LC Modules 1–119 (Middle):

Module 15 — Format is Force (presentation matters as much as substance)

Module 29 — Appeal Starts Early (preserving record at oral argument)

Exercises for anticipating opposing counsel’s moves

Master FG v1.0 (Top):

Serves as a case study archive — students/clinics can study actual transcripts and reflections

Turns one litigant’s prep into permanent teaching material

FG-1000 (Base):

FG-800 — Spotting Judicial Bias in Real Time

Master FG v1.0 (Top):

Ensures these materials are preserved for future cohorts

Builds a curriculum backbone for academic integration

System Insight

Bottom-Up (Litigant): Start with FG micro-modules in the moment → build deeper strategy via LC Modules → later contribute to the Master archive.

Top-Down (Educator): Teach from the Master archive → explain strategy with LC Modules → give students FG checklists for practice.

✅ This mapping shows that every tier reinforces the others — immediate survival, structured learning, and permanent preservation.
