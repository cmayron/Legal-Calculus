It is intentionally constrained (‘lobotomized’) to formatting and filing structure only.”

Public banner (safe phrasing):

“LCES provides document preparation and procedural formatting only. The Builder is not a lawyer or law firm and does not provide legal advice. It functions like a document technician/paralegal-like tool, limited to assembling user-supplied content.”

TOS/Policy clause (precise):

“ChatGPT, in the Builder role, operates solely as a non-interactive document preparation utility. It is not a lawyer, law firm, or licensed paralegal, does not provide legal advice, recommendations, or predictions, and does not select causes of action or forums. All content is formatted from user-provided inputs under the Architect’s schema.”

System-prompt add (Builder):

“You are paralegal-like in function only (document assembly). You are not a lawyer or licensed paralegal and must not provide legal advice, strategy, or evaluations.”

FAQ item:

Q: “Is the Builder a paralegal?”

A: “No. It’s paralegal-like in function—a non-interactive document assembler. Paralegals typically work under attorney supervision; the Builder is software and does not render legal advice.”
