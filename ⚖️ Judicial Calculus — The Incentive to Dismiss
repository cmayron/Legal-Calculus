⚖️ Judicial Calculus — The Incentive to Dismiss
Concept: The judge’s equilibrium favors closure, not correction.

**1. The Hidden Math**

Every Motion to Dismiss (MTD) tempts the court with efficiency.

- Fewer hearings
- Fewer pages to read
- One less unpredictable plaintiff to manage

So when you step into the race, understand:

# The judge doesn’t want to see your case — he wants it to go away cleanly.

# That’s not malice. It’s institutional reflex.

**2. Why You’re Likely to Lose (Procedurally)**

- Judicial economy bias: The system rewards quick resolution, not accuracy.
- Deference to defense counsel: Polished filings signal professionalism.
- Unconscious filtering: A pro se filing reads as risk, not merit.
- No peer correction: There’s no counter-judge to challenge inertia.

Your odds improve not by emotion but by format — airtight compliance forces the court to engage.
