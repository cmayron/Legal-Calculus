# **Simple, Tight, Iterative**

**1️⃣**

**Pro Se Mode (Build & Assert)**

- Purpose: You create the full filing — complaint, motion, TRO, or memo — in your authentic voice, as a self-advocating litigant.
- Goal: clarity, completeness, procedural compliance, factual truth.
- Output: a clean, chronological, captioned, exhibit-linked draft ready for external review.
- Mindset: You’re presenting what should be heard, unfiltered.

**2️⃣**

**Second-Opinion Mode (Gemini / Dual-Analysis)**

- Purpose: Gemini engages your filing as both reviewer and adversary.
It plays two roles at once:
    - Legal Advisor Lens: strengthens reasoning, law, and procedural grounding.
    - Red-Team Lens: stress-tests your logic, anticipates opposition, exposes weak points.
- 
- Goal: merge refinement and challenge in one pass — instead of separate Red-Team sessions.
- Output: a single annotated “Gemini Report” with:
    - Suggested improvements (citations, structure, factual clarity)
    - Embedded counterarguments and judge-risk notes
    - Severity flags (Fatal / Major / Minor)
    - Recommended language patches
- 

**3️⃣**

**You (Re-builder Pass)**

- Review Gemini’s dual-mode output.
- Patch weaknesses, clarify strengths.
- Log changes in the Fix List (only one table needed).
- Re-submit the updated draft for a short verification check (Gemini’s quick confirmation pass).

Then you file → archive → teach.

# **🧭 Process Summary**

Pro Se Mode  →  Second-Opinion Mode (Gemini = Advisor + Red Team)
↘                         ↙
Patch & Rebuild  →  Finalize → Archive

This creates a two-engine loop — your lived perspective + AI’s analytical mirror.

Every round strengthens structure and predictive awareness without fragmenting the workflow.
