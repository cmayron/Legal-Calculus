**LCES is an educational system — not legal advice.**

LCES (Legal Calculus Educational System) helps you understand procedural structure and build a durable legal record. It is **not** a substitute for a lawyer or official legal guidance.

## Your Responsibility

**You are solely responsible for understanding and following the rules, deadlines, and filing requirements in your own jurisdiction.**

LCES provides procedural literacy—teaching you *how* to format documents, organize evidence, and follow court rules. It does not provide case-specific legal strategy or tell you what arguments to make.

## Always Verify:

- ✅ The current local rules and administrative orders in your court
- 🗓️ Deadlines and filing schedules specific to your case
- 🧾 Required forms, fees, and service methods
- 🏛️ The correct court or agency for your filing
- 📋 Jurisdictional requirements (venue, standing, etc.)

<aside>
**LCES provides structure — you provide compliance.**

The format carries the memory; human judgment carries the meaning. You must edit, verify, and take full responsibility for all filings.

## When in Doubt

Consult with:

- A local legal aid clinic
- Your court's self-help center
- A licensed attorney in your jurisdiction

LCES is a procedural primer and workflow tool—a second opinion and survival guide for those navigating the legal system. It is part of a model where **human persistence + AI scaffolding = empowerment**, but ultimate responsibility rests with you.

<aside>
**Core Principle:** LCES turns lived litigation into structured learning and fast action, helping you build a record across filings, hearings, and appeals—but you must ensure that record complies with your jurisdiction's specific requirements.
