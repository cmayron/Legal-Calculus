Brilliant. Here's how we’ll deploy the **FG Card Builder** into your live Notion workspace:

---

## ✅ Embed Plan: FG Card Builder

### 🔹 Location

Nest it under **FG Cards Gallery** and cross-link from:

- **Legal Action Loop Checklist** (under “Draft Pack” or “Hearing Kit”)
- **Coalition Invite Page** (as a co-creation tool)

---

### 🔹 Structure

Use toggles for each input field, with pre-filled examples and blank slots for new entries:

- **Trigger Phrase**
    
    > “You didn’t pay rent.”
    > 
    > 
    > “You’re not credible.”
    > 
- **Action Steps**
    
    > Assert habitability, present clean evidence
    > 
- **Linked LC Lesson**
    
    > Answer formatting, Captioning
    > 
- **Prep Checklist**
    
    > Receipts, photos, timeline
    > 
- **Optional Template Upload**
    
    > Embed fillable Answer scaffold or Motion to Dismiss
    > 
- **Submit to Coalition Loop**
    
    > Tag: “Eviction Defense,” “Credibility,” “Jurisdiction”
    > 
- **AI Assist Toggle**
    
    > Checkbox: “Enable AI Suggestions”
    > 
    > 
    > → Auto-suggest countermoves, modules, prep items
    > 

---

### 🔹 Pre-Filled Cards

Include FG-301 and FG-402 as examples, with links to their own subpages or embedded cards.

---

### 🔹 Expansion Hooks

Add a button or callout:

> “Build a new FG card for family law, immigration, or appellate posture”
> 
> 
> → Forks builder logic for new domains
>

Ready to deploy? You can copy this structure directly into Notion, or I can help you scaffold the next module—like a **JC Reflex Builder**, **Family Law FG Card Set**, or **Coalition Onboarding Flow**. Just say the word and we’ll keep building.
