⭐ 2. FIELD GUIDE INTRODUCTION

Where the Pressure Valve → Diagnosis → Intervention come together

Introduction: How to Use This Field Guide

The legal system functions like a malfunctioning body:
	•	symptoms appear (retaliation, silence, obstruction),
	•	signals get ignored,
	•	inflammation spreads,
	•	pressure builds.

Most people enter the system emotionally overwhelmed.
That is exactly when the system begins using its pressure-valve machinery:
	•	delay,
	•	procedure,
	•	silence,
	•	“lost” filings,
	•	complexity,
	•	intimidation.

This Field Guide flips the script.

Here, you learn to think like a physician:

1. Diagnose the system failure
2. Identify the right intervention
3. Apply the correct procedural treatment
4. Preserve the record like a medical chart

You are not here to “think like a lawyer.”
You are here to see the patterns, not the theater.

This guide gives you:
	•	filing structures,
	•	templates,
	•	checklists,
	•	evidence systems,
	•	emergency “Rescue Tools,”
	•	and AI-supported drafting instructions.

It is the “How” of Legal Calculus — the practical arm of the system.
