## 1) Choose Your Mode

- **Pro Se Crisis Mode** → open the *Crisis Kit* and run the 5‑minute stabilizer.
- **Coalition/Clinic Mode** → open *Matter Dashboard* (template) and duplicate for your case.
- **School Mode (LCES School)** → open the *Syllabus/Scrolls* and start Module 1.
- **Builder/Strategist Mode** → jump to the *Brilliant Model — Handoffs*.

## 2) Spin Up a Matter (2 minutes)

- Duplicate **Matter Dashboard (Template)** → rename with `COURT–Matter–YYYYMMDD`.
- Import **Starter Kit CSVs** (only if not done) and filter each linked view to your Matter.
- Click **New Issue (P0)** button and log the first blocker.

## 3) Daily Ritual (AM/PM)

- AM: check deadlines, service, exhibits; update 3 priorities.
- PM: log outcomes + next steps; capture any new exhibits; hash files.
- Tiny nudge: text your **ops buddy** each day. If stress spikes, book a short therapy check‑in—calm brains write cleaner filings.

## 4) Handoffs at a Glance

- **Architect → Builder** (Intake Bundle) → **Builder → Strategist** (Draft Packet) → **Strategist → Architect** (Report + updates) → **Human Lead** files.
- The record is the remedy: update the Exhibit Registry, Service Matrix, and Issues each loop.
