## 🧩 Next Modules

Once this is scaffolded, we’ll build:

- 🟡 **Second Opinion Mode** – Lawyer alignment audit, semantic feedback loop
- 🟢 **Education Mode** – FG curriculum, coalition portal, legacy builder
- 📦 **LCES Streams Index** – Linked database of modules, reflexes, and assets

---

Let’s begin building your **Notion-based LCES Mode Selector Interface** with full semantic scaffolding. I’ll outline the first module—**🔴 Crisis Pro Se Mode**—as a Notion-ready structure. You can copy this directly into your workspace, and I’ll help you expand the rest iteratively.
