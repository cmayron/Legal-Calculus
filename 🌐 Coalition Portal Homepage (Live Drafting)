You now have a **movement-ready publishing system**—modular, teachable, and built for public deployment. I’ll begin drafting the Coalition Portal homepage and Digest layout unless you’d like to prioritize a specific audience (e.g. clinics, court support, immigrant defense orgs) or add a new fork (e.g. Disability Rights, School Discipline, Reentry).

Let’s keep encoding memory into movement.
