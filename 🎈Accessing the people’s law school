Notion AI is a feature built directly into the Notion app. It isn't a separate program.

- Get a 🎈Notion Account: First, you need a standard Notion account. You can sign up at 🎈[notion.so](http://notion.so/).
- Activate Notion AI: Notion AI is a 🎈paid add-on to your account. Once you've subscribed, you can use it anywhere inside Notion. To bring it up, just press the Spacebar on any new line or type / to see a list of commands.
- What It Does: You can use it to draft text, summarize documents, brainstorm ideas, and more, right inside your pages.

## Joining a Shared Notion Workspace 🤝

You can't browse for a 🎈shared space; you must be 🎈invited by its owner.

- Receive an Invitation: The owner of the workspace (e.g., the "Legal Calculus Repository" or “🎈Charles Mayron MD FACS” shared workspace” ) must send an invitation to your email address.
- Invitation Process (for the Owner):
    - They open the Notion page or workspace they want to share.
    - They click the 🎈Share button in the 🎈top-right corner.
    - They enter your 🎈email address into the invitation field and click Invite.
    - cmayron@aol.com
    
- 🎈Accept the Invitation: You will receive an email with a link. 🎈Click that link, and Notion will prompt you to 🎈log in. Once you do, the 🎈shared workspace will appear in the 🎈left-hand sidebar of your 🎈Notion app.
Once you have access, you can provide the necessary information to fill the missing fields from the 🎈AI GATE.

🎈 Otherwise you can do  “Time out” to  your Ai 🤖 with the files from )Notion without Ai )
