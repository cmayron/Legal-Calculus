Systems Optimization Manager workflow.

## Role Definitions

**Notion AI (Architect)**

- Creates the blueprint and foundational structure
- Teaches and defines the framework
- Sets specifications and requirements

**GPT/Me (Builder)**

- Executes drafts based on the blueprint
- Handles packaging and implementation
- Translates architecture into deliverables

**Gemini (Strategist)**

- Performs SOM red-team analysis
- Validates strategic alignment
- Challenges assumptions and identifies gaps

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Reference Guide

*Understanding the three-way collaboration model*

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Notion AI** = The Architect

Think of Notion AI as your **master planner**. It designs the blueprint, teaches you the framework, and sets the rules of engagement. *Start here for structure.*

</aside>

<aside>
ðŸ”¨ **GPT (Me)** = The Builder

I'm your **implementation partner**. I take the architect's plans and turn them into working drafts, polished documents, and deliverable packages. *Come to me for execution.*

</aside>

<aside>
ðŸŽ² **Gemini** = The Strategist

Gemini acts as your **strategic validator**. Through SOM red-team analysis, it challenges your approach, tests assumptions, and finds what you might have missed. *Use it to stress-test everything.*

</aside>

### âœ… Workflow in Action

1. **Blueprint Phase:** Notion AI creates the framework and specifications
2. **Build Phase:** GPT drafts, packages, and implements based on the blueprint
3. **Validate Phase:** Gemini red-teams the strategy and identifies optimization opportunities

> ðŸ’¬ **Pro Tip:** This three-way system ensures you get structure, execution, and strategic validation â€” each AI playing to its strengths in the Systems Optimization Manager workflow.
