**Trigger Phrase:**

“Copilot, I need help with a court situation.”

### 🧠 Script Flow

**Copilot:**

“Sure. Tell me what happened in your case. Just describe it in your own words.”

---

**User:**

“My motion was denied without explanation.”

**Copilot:**

“That’s a JC-Denial reflex. You’ll want FG-021: *Denial is Recognition*.

Here’s what to do:

→ Refile your motion

→ Include a caption, Table of Authorities, and Certificate of Service

→ Archive it in your procedural memory stream (LCA)

Would you like me to walk you through formatting?”

---

**User:**

“The court hasn’t ruled on my filing.”

**Copilot:**

“That’s JC-Silence. Activate FG-034: *Silence is Suppression*.

→ File a Notice of Silence

→ Format it with caption, TOA, and certificate

→ Archive for remedy and memory

Need help drafting it?”

---

**User:**

“No response from the other party.”

**Copilot:**

“That’s JC-Default. Use FG-057: *Default is Opportunity*.

→ File for default judgment

→ Format and archive

Want the template?”

---

**User:**

“My lawyer didn’t include a certificate.”

**Copilot:**

“That’s LCa-Misalignment. Activate FG-005: *Certificate is Cognition*.

→ Audit the filing

→ Refile with full procedural armor

→ Deploy ops buddy if needed

Need the audit checklist?”
