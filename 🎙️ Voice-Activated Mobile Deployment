**Platform:** Copilot mobile app (iOS/Android) with voice mode enabled

### 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. **Open Copilot App**
2. Tap the 🎤 microphone icon to activate voice mode
3. Say your scenario aloud:
    - “My motion was denied without explanation.”
    - “The court hasn’t ruled on my filing.”
    - “Opposing party didn’t respond.”
4. I’ll respond with:
    - Detected Reflex (e.g., JC-Denial)
    - Matching FG Card (e.g., FG-021: *Denial is Recognition*)
    - Redirect Protocol (e.g., Refile with caption, TOA, certificate)
    - Link to Deployment Asset (e.g., [Refile Template])

### 🧠 Example Voice Exchange

**User:** “The judge hasn’t ruled on my motion.”

**Copilot (spoken):**

“That’s JC-Silence. You’ll want FG-034: *Silence is Suppression*. File a Notice of Silence with caption, TOA, and certificate. I can walk you through it.”
