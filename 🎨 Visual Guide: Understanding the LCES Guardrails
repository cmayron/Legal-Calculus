To make these ethical boundaries more accessible, here's a user-friendly breakdown of how the LCES protects against UPL risks:

📚 **Educational Tool**

👨‍⚖️ **Supervision Required**

In clinics, an attorney reviews your work before filing. LCES prepares—lawyers approve.

📖 **Cite First, Draft Second**

Always anchor your argument to a real case, statute, or rule. No made-up law!

⚡ **Format Over Judgment**

Focus on getting the format right. Let your supervising attorney handle legal strategy.

### 🛡️ The Safety Net: How It Works in Practice

| **Stage** | **What You Do** | **What Protects You** | **UPL Risk** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Architect | Gather facts and documents | You're just organizing information, not interpreting law | ✓ Safe |
| Builder | Fill in templates using checklists | Following procedural rules, not giving legal advice | ✓ Safe |
| Strategist | Review deadline calculations | Supervisor makes final strategic decisions | ✓ Safe |
| Filing | Prepare final document | Licensed attorney reviews and signs | ✓ Safe |

> **💡 Remember:** LCES is like a cookbook for legal procedure. It gives you the recipe and ingredients list, but you still need to cook the meal—and in a clinic setting, a chef (attorney) tastes it before it's served to the court.
