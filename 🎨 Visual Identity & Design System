LCES uses color to guide users through complex procedural terrain — each layer has its own visual signature to help learners recognize context instantly.

## Layer Color Coding

- **Learning Layer (LC/LCA)** — Blue: calm, foundational knowledge
- **Action Layer (FG/FGA)** — Green: go, deploy, execute
- **Defense Layer (JC/LCa)** — Orange: caution, anticipate resistance

## Document Status Colors

- **Draft** — Gray: work in progress
- **Review Needed** — Yellow: requires human check
- **Ready to File** — Green: compliant & complete
- **Filed & Archived** — Blue: preserved in record
- **Urgent / Deadline** — Red: time-sensitive action required

## Template Highlighting

Every template uses color-coded sections:

- Caption & header formatting
- Body content & relief requested
- Service proofs & exhibits checklist
- Signature & certificate blocks

## Card System Visual Hierarchy

**FG Cards** use background colors to signal task type:

- 💼 Pre-filing tasks
- ⚖️ Court filings
- 🎤 Hearing prep
- 📁 Archive & preservation
