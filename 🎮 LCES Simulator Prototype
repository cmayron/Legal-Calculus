**Module 1:**

**The 12(b)(6) Gauntlet & The FRCP 15 Gambit**

**🧩 Scenario Overview**

Objective: Survive a Motion to Dismiss by using Legal Calculus, not luck.

You are a pro se plaintiff in federal court.

The State’s Attorney General has filed a 100-page Motion to Dismiss under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).

Your response is due in 14 days.

You have just discovered new evidence and realized your original complaint omitted a key claim.

What do you do?

# **⚖️**

# **Choose Your Move**

**A. The Direct Confrontation**

Action: Spend 14 days drafting a 100-page opposition.

Logic: Fight brilliance with brilliance.

| **Factor** | **Assessment** |
| --- | --- |
| Probability | ðŸ”´ Low â€” Youâ€™re defending a structurally flawed complaint. |
| Cost/Benefit | âš ï¸ High cost, low reward. |
| Opponent Reaction | Easy reply: â€œPlaintiff failed to cure deficiencies.â€ |
| Judicial Response | Bound to rule on the old complaint. |
| Preservation | âŒ No new evidence or claims preserved. |

🧮 Legal Calculus Outcome: You played defense on their terms.

📜 Result: Dismissed. Your logic was sound but not strategic.

Lesson: Never fight where they aim. Shift the venue—procedurally.

**B. The FRCP 15 Gambit**

Action: File a Motion to Amend “As of Right” (Rule 15(a)(1)(B)) within the 21-day post-MTD window.

Logic: Change the board, not the pieces.

| **Factor** | **Assessment** |
| --- | --- |
| Probability | ðŸŸ¢ Very High â€” Amendment as of right is non-discretionary. |
| Cost/Benefit | ðŸŸ¢ Low cost, high yield. |
| Opponent Reaction | Must restart. Their MTD becomes moot. |
| Judicial Response | Cannot rule on an obsolete pleading. |
| Preservation | ðŸŸ¢ New evidence + claim now in the record. |

🧮 Legal Calculus Outcome: You shifted the procedural timeline.

📜 Result: Motion to Amend granted. Defendants’ MTD denied as moot.

They must now re-plead or answer your new complaint.

**C. The Plea**

Action: File a Motion for Extension of Time.

Logic: Delay = survival.

| **Factor** | **Assessment** |
| --- | --- |
| Probability | ðŸŸ¡ Medium â€” Judge might allow brief extension. |
| Cost/Benefit | âšª Low cost, no strategic benefit. |
| Opponent Reaction | Waits calmly. |
| Judicial Response | Sees you as disorganized. |
| Preservation | âŒ You bought time, not leverage. |

🧮 Legal Calculus Outcome: You stayed alive but didn’t move forward.

📜 Result: Thirty days gained, but no positional change.

Badge: ⏳ Delay ≠ Defense.

# **🧭**

# **Debrief**

By choosing Option B, you applied Procedural Lawfare:

You didn’t fight the 12(b)(6) battle — you replaced the terrain with Rule 15.

You neutralized 100 pages of opposition with one procedural pivot.

That’s the essence of Legal Calculus: change the equation, not the argument.

Structure for Notion / LMS build:

- 🧠 “Read Mode” = Scroll (theory)
- 🎯 “Play Mode” = Choice cards → hidden result blocks
- 🧩 “Sandbox Mode” = Timed path simulation (with branching dialogue)
- 🧾 “Post-Game” = Auto-generated debrief + badge (stored in user dashboard)

Possible logic structure (pseudo-code):

IF user chooses A → outcome: dismissed → feedback: procedural rigidity = loss
IF user chooses B → outcome: success → unlock next module
IF user chooses C → outcome: delay → loop back to A or B
