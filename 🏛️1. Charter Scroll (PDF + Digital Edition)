# **igital Edition)**

What I’ll deliver:

- A full parchment-style PDF draft of the Charter of Access, centered, serif font, decorative lines, signature field, and “Justice Shouldn’t Require Privilege” seal footer.
- A matching digital layout (Substack/Notion-ready) with block quotes and pull-out affirmations.

Goal: To serve as the visual and moral centerpiece of LCES — a document people can sign, display, or cite.

# **2. Curriculum Codex (Onboarding Guide)**

What I’ll build after the Charter PDF:

- Five teaching modules, each about one of the Charter’s Articles.
- Each will include: a reading section, reflection prompt, discussion question, and “Procedural Practice” exercise.
- Optional closing reflection: “What procedural literacy means to me.”

Goal: To train early coalition members and clinic educators using the Charter as a living text.

# **3. Infographic (Public Scroll)**

What I’ll generate once the Codex text is set:

- A high-contrast vertical graphic (poster + feed-ready version).
- Central quote: “Justice Shouldn’t Require Privilege.”
- Four quadrants: Equity, Reality, Improvement, Access.
- Footer: Legal Calculus Educational Systems — Procedural Literacy for All.

Goal: To give you a shareable, accessible visual that sparks curiosity and collaboration.
