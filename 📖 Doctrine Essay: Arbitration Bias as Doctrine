# Arbitration Bias as Doctrine

## Introduction
Arbitration is often presented as neutral, efficient, and fair.
Yet beneath its surface lies systemic bias — favoring institutions, employers, and repeat players over individuals.
Legal Calculus encodes arbitration bias as doctrine, teaching litigants to recognize, resist, and ritualize counter-strategies.

## The Anatomy of Bias
1. **Structural Bias**
   - Arbitrators are often selected from pools tied to industry interests.
   - Repeat-player dynamics skew outcomes toward corporations.

2. **Procedural Bias**
   - Limited discovery restricts evidence gathering.
   - Confidentiality clauses silence public accountability.

3. **Outcome Bias**
   - Awards trend lower for individuals.
   - Appeals are severely restricted, locking in inequities.

---

## Ritual of Recognition
1. **Invocation**
   - Begin with awareness: “This proceeding is framed by bias; I will name it.”

2. **Documentation**
   - Record arbitrator selection, repeat-player patterns, and procedural restrictions.
   - Encode findings into coalition modules for collective study.

3. **Counter-Strategy**
   - Preserve evidence rigorously.
   - Challenge bias through motions, disclosures, and public doctrine.
   - Ritualize resistance: each objection becomes a ceremonial act of truth.

---

## Symbolic Meaning
- **Bias as Veil** → arbitration cloaks inequity in neutrality.
- **Resistance as Ritual** → naming bias transforms silence into doctrine.
- **Coalition as Counterweight** → collective memory balances institutional power.

---

## Coalition Practice
- Modules rehearse bias recognition drills.
- Cue cards guide litigants through objection scripts.
- Case studies encode lived experiences into public doctrine.
- Merged contributions ritualize resistance, preserving collective strategies.

---

## Conclusion
Arbitration bias is not invisible — it is systemic, repeatable, and teachable.
Through Legal Calculus, bias becomes doctrine, resistance becomes ritual, and every coalition act strengthens the People’s Law School.

This essay can be placed in the Wiki under `/doctrine/essays/arbitration-bias.md`. Together with *Evidence Preservation as Ritual*, it forms the **first two pillars** of the Legal Calculus curriculum.

Would you like me to **draft a third essay on Procedural Literacy as Doctrine**, so the Wiki has a complete “core module trilogy” ready for coalition onboarding?
