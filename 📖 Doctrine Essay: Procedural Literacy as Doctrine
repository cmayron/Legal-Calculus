# Procedural Literacy as Doctrine

## Introduction
Procedural literacy is the ability to read, understand, and act within the structures of law.
It is the foundation of empowerment for pro se litigants and coalitions.
Legal Calculus encodes procedural literacy as doctrine, teaching that every rule, filing, and ritual can be made transparent and reproducible.

## The Elements of Literacy
1. **Reading the System**
   - Learn to decode statutes, rules, and contracts.
   - Translate legal jargon into plain language.
   - Treat each document as a text to be studied, annotated, and ritualized.

2. **Mapping the Process**
   - Visualize procedures as flowcharts and cue cards.
   - Identify checkpoints: filing deadlines, motions, hearings.
   - Ritualize navigation: each step rehearsed as a coalition drill.

3. **Acting with Agency**
   - Draft filings with clarity and provenance.
   - Preserve evidence and objections as teaching artifacts.
   - Encode actions into doctrine so others can follow the path.

## Ritual of Literacy
1. **Invocation**
   - Begin with intent: “I will read the system as text, not mystery.”

2. **Study**
   - Break down rules into modular lessons.
   - Use coalition scripts to rehearse filings and objections.

3. **Practice**
   - Submit filings as ritual acts.
   - Treat each procedural step as a rehearsal for teaching.

4. **Publishing**
   - Encode lessons into coalition modules.
   - Share doctrine through GitHub contributions, making literacy collective.

## Symbolic Meaning
- **Literacy as Light** → illuminating hidden structures of law.
- **Literacy as Ritual** → transforming study into ceremony.
- **Literacy as Coalition** → making navigation a shared act of empowerment.

---

## Coalition Practice
- Orientation modules teach literacy drills.
- Cue cards guide coalition members through filings and hearings.
- Case studies encode lived experiences into doctrine.
- Contributions ritualize literacy, preserving lessons for future advocates.

---

## Conclusion
Procedural literacy is the cornerstone of the People’s Law School.
Through Legal Calculus, every filing becomes a lesson, every objection a ritual, and every coalition act a step toward transparency and justice.
