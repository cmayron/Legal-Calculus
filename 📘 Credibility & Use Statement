ðŸ“˜ Credibility & Use Statement

Legal Calculus Educational System (LCES) is built on six principles:
	1.	Free â€” No paywalls. Justice should not require privilege.
	2.	Open â€” Licensed under Creative Commons (CC BY-NC-SA). Anyone may adapt, remix, and expand for the public good.
	3.	ChatGPT as Author â€” All modules and cards were authored by ChatGPT (GPT-5). This is disclosed openly for credibility.
	4.	Understand Limitations â€” AI is powerful but imperfect. Users must edit, verify, and take responsibility for filings.
	5.	Not a Replacement for Lawyers â€” LCES is a second opinion, a guide, and a survival kit â€” not formal representation.
	6.	For Pro Se Survival â€” Courts are hostile to pro se litigants. LCES is built as a survival approach, offering structure, coherence, and a record.

ðŸ“Œ Looking Ahead

As AI improves, the survival function of LCES may no longer be needed. Future tools may allow pro se litigants to stand equal in court without an intermediary system.

Until then, LCES is a lifeline:
	â€¢	A structured bridge between injustice and record.
	â€¢	A pathway for coherence in filings and rebuttals.
	â€¢	A public tool for those who cannot afford silence.
