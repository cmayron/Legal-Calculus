Module 4 – Evidence Is Only Evidence If It’s in the Record 📂🔒

⸻

⚖️ Core Message

What you know is not evidence.
What you file — and what the court accepts into the record — is evidence. The record is the only truth the system will remember.

⸻

📖 Lesson Content
	•	Evidence as Filing 📑 — If it is not attached, submitted, or docketed, it does not exist legally. Courts cannot rely on what they do not see in the record.
	•	Evidence as Survival 🛡️ — Oral arguments fade; transcripts may not exist; memory can be denied. A filed exhibit endures.
	•	Evidence as Leverage ⚖️ — Even if ignored, filed evidence creates pressure. On appeal, it forces acknowledgment that the court had access to it.

📝 Assignment

Choose one piece of “evidence” from your case (e.g., email, receipt, transcript, screenshot). Draft a Notice of Filing of Exhibit that:
	1.	Identifies the exhibit by letter or number.
	2.	States its relevance in one or two sentences.
	3.	Preserves it in the record without arguing the merits.

💡 Reflection

Evidence that is not in the record may as well not exist. Courts operate on documents, not memory. The key insight: silence in the record is fatal, but filing creates survival.
