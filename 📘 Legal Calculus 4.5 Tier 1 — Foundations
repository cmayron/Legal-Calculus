# **Module 1 – Filing is Protest ✊📄**

# **⚖️ Core Message**

Filing is not simply a request for relief. It is a declaration that the matter exists, that you exist, and that injustice cannot be ignored.

# **📖 Lesson Content**

·       - Filing as Existence 📝 — Courts cannot act on what is not in the record.

·       - Filing as Leverage ⚖️ — Filing forces both the court and the opposing side to respond.

·       - Filing as Legacy 📚 — Even if denied, a filing becomes permanent record.

# **📝 Assignment**

# **📝 Assignment**

Reformat your strongest legal argument into: a clean caption page, a numbered statement of facts, and a conclusion with the requested relief in bold.
