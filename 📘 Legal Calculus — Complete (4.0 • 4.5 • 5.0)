🧰 For pro se (your quickest path)

Start with 4.0 (Modules 1–5).

Keep Tier 2 handy for traps: silence, strike, misclassification, pretext.

Always write the relief clause and secure a signed order (Finality Frame, M119).

Archive everything (public mirrors + index) to protect access.

📰 For journalists / advocacy groups

See Tier 7 for story frames + media kits + FOIA targets.

Use 5.0’s suppression logs and rule-change memo (24-hour emergency docketing; online “Received” stamps).
