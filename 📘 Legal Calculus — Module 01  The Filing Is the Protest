The Filing Is the Protest

⚖️ Core Message

Filing turns grievance into action. Speech becomes record; record becomes remedy.

2. Pick the right vehicle: Motion, Notice, Application, or Complaint.
3. Align the ask with the rule — every request should cite an authority.
4. Write numbered facts; attach proof; end with a proposed order when appropriate.
