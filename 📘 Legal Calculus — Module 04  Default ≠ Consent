Default ≠ Consent

⚖️ Core Message

Your rights aren’t waived simply because the other side asserts them. Preserve objections and request findings.
📖 Lesson Content

1. Silence under coercive timelines is not consent when objections are preserved.
2. Use 'Reservation of Rights' to keep defenses and statutory protections live.
3. Ask for short findings when a ruling relies on 'consent' by silence.
4. Pair with a Proposed Order clarifying preserved issues.
