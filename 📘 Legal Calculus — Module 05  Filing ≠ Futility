Filing ≠ Futility

⚖️ Core Message

Futility language doesn’t end your duty to build a record. Filing preserves appellate rights.
📖 Lesson Content

1. Ask for reasons when the court cites 'futility.'
2. Narrow any request and propose less‑restrictive alternatives.
3. If denied, file a short notice preserving the lack of reasons.
4. Treat each response as record scaffolding for review.
📝 Assignment
