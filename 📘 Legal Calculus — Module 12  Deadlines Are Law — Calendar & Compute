Deadlines Are Law — Calendar & Compute

⚖️ Core Message

Computing time correctly prevents silent dismissals. Treat dates like elements.
📖 Lesson Content

1. Know your regime: Rule 6, local rules, and any special orders control computation.
2. Exclude the trigger day; include the last day unless it’s a weekend/holiday.
3. Add mailing days when rules require; watch time‑zone cutoffs and ECF hours.
4. Build a deadline table for each filing and cite it when timeliness is disputed.
📝 Assignment

Create a 6‑row deadline table from a hypothetical filing date, showing rule, computation, and final due date.
