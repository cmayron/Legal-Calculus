The Filing Trap

⚖️ Core Message

Filing alone isn’t enough.

If format, caption, and title aren’t precise, the court may treat your filing as if it never existed.

The trap is believing “on the docket” means “in the record.”

📖 Lesson Content

The Illusion of Filing

Many pro se litigants think: “If I hand it in, I’ve preserved it.”

But a clerk can stamp it “received but not filed,” mark it “deficient,” or docket it as a “letter.”

Once mislabeled, the court can later pretend the argument never entered the case.

The Power of Titles

A filing titled “Letter” → may never be reviewed.

A filing titled “Notice of Procedural Obstruction” → enters the legal memory of the case.

Judges respond to document categories, not personal narratives.

Captions as Anchors

Without the correct court name, case number, and parties, your filing drifts into the void.

Captions force the clerk to connect your filing to the live case — making it part of the permanent record.

Format as Shield

Numbered paragraphs, spacing, and Certificates of Service aren’t decoration — they are the minimum armor to block erasure.

Proper formatting signals: “This belongs in the judicial record.”

📝 Assignment

Draft a 1–2 page mock filing where you:

Use a formal caption with court, parties, and case number.

Title the document with a procedural function (e.g., “Notice of Error in Clerk Docketing”).

Number each paragraph.

End with a Certificate of Service.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  

DISTRICT OF ARIZONA  

CHARLES MAYRON, Plaintiff,  

v.  

JENNIFER RYAN-TOUHILL, in her official capacity, et al., Defendants.  

Case No. 2:25-cv-02480-SHD  

NOTICE OF CLERK DOCKETING ERROR

1. Plaintiff respectfully submits this Notice to preserve the record concerning

   mislabeling of Plaintiff’s filing dated July 24, 2025.  

2. The Clerk docketed the submission as “Letter” despite its caption and structure

   as a Motion.  

3. This mislabeling obstructs judicial review and risks constructive denial of

   access to court.  

4. Plaintiff files this Notice to ensure the record accurately reflects the

   procedural posture of the filing.

I certify that on August 18, 2025, I mailed a true and correct copy of this

filing to the Office of the Arizona Attorney General, 2005 N Central Ave,

Phoenix, AZ 85004.  

/s/ Charles Mayron

💡 Reflection Summary

Filing ≠ Memory.

Courts remember categories, not stories.

Caption + Title = Survival.

🎨 Visual Concept

Left: A crumpled “Letter to Judge” vanishing into a wastebasket.

Right: A glowing “Notice of Error” stamped and locked in a docket book. Caption overlay: “Format saves. Filing alone fails.”
