The Strike Reflex

⚖️ Core Message

When courts don’t want your words in the record, they don’t just deny — they strike.

Striking erases your filing as though it never existed.

The reflex is suppression disguised as tidiness.

📖 Lesson Content

What “Strike” Really Means

A denied motion remains part of the record.

A struck filing is erased, treated as if it never happened.

Judges and clerks use “strike” to scrub inconvenient filings from appellate review.

Tactics Behind Striking

Sua sponte striking: Judge strikes without a motion from the other side.

Rule-based striking: Claiming a filing was “improper” (wrong length, wrong label).

Targeted striking: Removing exhibits or supplemental replies that expose misconduct.

How Strikes Harm Pro Se Litigants

Appellate courts often won’t review filings that aren’t in the record.

Opposing counsel can argue: “That was never before the trial court.”

The strike reflex converts pro se evidence into ghost filings.

Strategies to Resist

Always keep your struck filing in your own archive.

File a Notice of Striking documenting what was removed.

Use the strike itself as evidence of procedural suppression.

📝 Assignment

Draft a Notice of Striking that:

Identifies the document struck.

Notes whether the strike was sua sponte or by motion.

States why the filing was necessary to the record.

Preserves the strike itself as evidence.

Case No. 

NOTICE OF STRIKING

1. Plaintiff respectfully submits this Notice to preserve the record concerning

   the Court’s sua sponte striking of Plaintiff’s Supplemental Reply filed

   August 10, 2025.  

2. The filing was struck as “without leave,” yet it addressed controlling

   precedent cited by Defendants for the first time in their Reply.  

3. The striking of this filing removes material evidence and obstructs appellate

   review.

   suppression of evidence through striking.

💡 Reflection Summary

Denial leaves a trace.

Striking erases the trace.

Preserve the strike so silence doesn’t win.

🎨 Visual Concept

A judge’s gavel slams down — but instead of sound, the page beneath vanishes into smoke. A shadow file drawer is left empty where the filing should be.
