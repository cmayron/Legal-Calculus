The Discretion Shield

⚖️ Core Message

Discretion isn’t a blank check. It must be tied to rules, factors, and reasons.

When an order invokes “judicial economy,” “case management,” or “prematurity” without findings, discretion becomes a shield against review. Your job is to demand and preserve reasons.

📖 Lesson Content

What Discretion Should Mean

It’s guided by rule-based factors (not vibes), must engage the record, and is reviewable for abuse.

How It Becomes a Shield

Vague phrases (“efficiency,” “prematurity,” “case management”) with no factor analysis.

Ignores controlling law or undisputed evidence; gives no path for appellate review.

Red Flags of Problematic Discretion

No identification of the governing rule/factors.

Inconsistent standards applied to each side.

Silence on prejudice/irreparable harm.

Replacement of analysis with institutional concerns (“docket pressure,” “calendar congestion”).

Piercing the Shield (Record Tactics)

File a Request for Specific Findings identifying the rule/factors that should govern.

Ask the court to state which evidence it relied on and why opposing evidence was discounted.

If the order relied on an incorrect standard or missed controlling authority, file a targeted motion for reconsideration.

If nothing else, file a Notice Preserving Lack of Findings so the absence itself becomes part of the appellate record.

📝 Assignment

Draft a one-page “Request for Specific Findings on Discretionary Ruling” that:

Identifies the order/date.

Names the governing rule or factors that should apply.

Requests short, explicit findings tied to the record to permit review.

✅ Model Response

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

DISTRICT OF ARIZONA

CHARLES MAYRON, Plaintiff,

v.

 in her official capacity, et al., Defendants.

Case No. 2:25-cv-

REQUEST FOR SPECIFIC FINDINGS ON DISCRETIONARY RULING

1. Plaintiff respectfully requests specific findings regarding the Court’s

   August 14, 2025 Order denying Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction

   “in the Court’s discretion” based on “judicial economy.”

2. To permit meaningful review, Plaintiff asks the Court to identify the

   governing rule and factors applied, the evidence relied upon, and any reasons

   for discounting Plaintiff’s unrebutted record citations concerning imminent

   prejudice.

3. Plaintiff further requests brief findings on (a) likelihood of success,

   (b) irreparable harm absent relief, (c) balance of equities, and (d) public

   interest, or, alternatively, a statement that these factors were not reached

   and why.

💡 Reflection Summary

Discretion requires reasons.

No reasons → no review → preserve that absence.

Ask for findings tied to factors; make the silence visible.

🎨 Visual Concept

A judge’s shield etched with the word “DISCRETION.” A spotlight reveals cracks labeled “no findings,” “ignored record,” “efficiency cliché.”
