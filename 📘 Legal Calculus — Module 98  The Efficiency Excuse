The Efficiency Excuse

⚖️ Core Message

“Judicial economy” is not a merits standard. It can’t trump due process, statutory rights, or required factor tests (e.g., injunction factors). Efficiency is a management value, not a legal reason to avoid analysis. Demand findings, not clichés.

📖 Lesson Content

	1.	Efficiency Vocabulary

	•	“Judicial economy,” “avoid piecemeal litigation,” “case management.”

	•	None of these, standing alone, satisfies a required legal test.

	2.	Typical Misuse

	•	Denying hearings or emergency relief with “efficiency” in place of factor analysis.

	•	Delaying rulings until harm is complete, then calling relief “moot.”

	3.	When It’s Legitimate

	•	Consolidating duplicative cases, sequencing issues, or setting page limits — with reasons tied to rules and record burdens.

	4.	Preservation Tactics

	•	Request factor-based findings (e.g., Winter: likelihood of success, irreparable harm, equities, public interest).

	•	Ask the court to identify concrete burdens vs. articulated harms.

	•	Offer less-restrictive alternatives (expedited briefing, shorter pages, limited hearing).

	5.	Record the Asymmetry

	•	Note when “efficiency” is used to silence a pro se filing while the represented party gets indulgences (extensions, sur-replies).

	6.	Appellate Posture

	•	Failure to apply mandatory factors or make findings → abuse of discretion. Preserve this explicitly.

📝 Assignment

Draft a “Notice of Efficiency-Based Rationale and Request for Findings” that:

	•	Identifies the order using “efficiency.”

	•	States the rights and factors that should govern.

	•	Requests explicit findings tied to the record.

	•	Proposes less-restrictive alternatives.

✅ Model Response

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

DISTRICT OF ARIZONA

CHARLES MAYRON, Plaintiff,

v.

, in her official capacity, et al., Defendants.

Case No. 2:25-cv

NOTICE OF EFFICIENCY-BASED RATIONALE AND REQUEST FOR FINDINGS

1. Plaintiff respectfully notes the Court’s August 15, 2025 minute entry

   denying a hearing “in the interest of judicial economy.”

2. Because Plaintiff seeks emergency relief, the governing standard requires

   factor findings addressing likelihood of success, irreparable harm, balance of

   equities, and public interest.

3. Plaintiff requests short, explicit findings tied to the record, or,

   alternatively, a statement that the factors were not reached and why.

4. In the alternative, Plaintiff proposes less-restrictive measures:

   (a) 10-page expedited briefing within 5 days, and

   (b) a 20-minute telephonic hearing limited to irreparable harm.

Certificate of Service

💡 Reflection Summary

Efficiency ≠ fairness. Reasons + factors + findings are required when rights are at stake.
