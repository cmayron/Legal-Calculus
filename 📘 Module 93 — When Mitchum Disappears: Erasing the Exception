📘 Module 93 — When Mitchum Disappears: Erasing the Exception

💡 Core Message

The Supreme Court carved out an exception in Mitchum v. Foster (1972), allowing federal courts to enjoin state proceedings under §1983. When a district court ignores Mitchum, it erases the Supreme Court’s authority — turning protection into denial.

⸻

📚 Teaching Block
	•	The Supreme Court’s Role: In Mitchum, the Court held §1983 is an expressly authorized exception to the Anti-Injunction Act.
	•	The District Court’s Deflection: By declaring “federal courts have no place in state court issues,” the judge inverted precedent.
	•	The Danger: This is not judicial restraint — it is judicial nullification of Supreme Court law.
	•	The Pattern: When federal judges erase exceptions (Mitchum, Ex parte Young), they reinforce state court impunity.

📝 Assignment

Write a one-paragraph “Mitchum Reminder” to insert into any §1983 motion. It should:
	1.	Quote the Supreme Court’s holding in Mitchum v. Foster.
	2.	Explain why the Anti-Injunction Act does not bar §1983 claims.
	3.	Anticipate and rebut a judge’s attempt to close the door.

✅ Model Answer (Skeleton)

“In Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S. 225 (1972), the Supreme Court held that 42 U.S.C. §1983 is an expressly authorized exception to the Anti-Injunction Act. Federal courts therefore retain jurisdiction to enjoin state proceedings where constitutional rights are at stake. Any suggestion that this Court lacks authority to review such claims ignores binding Supreme Court precedent.”

	•	Right: District Court boarded shut, captioned “The District Court Sealed It Shut — Anti-Injunction Act Misapplied.”
	•	Bottom Caption: When Mitchum disappears, denial replaces protection.

✅ This module pairs with your earlier “Doctrinal Deflection” piece — together they form a two-part cluster on judicial erasure of precedent.

Would you like me to package Module 92 and Module 93 together (with their visuals) as a mini-sequence called “Deflection and Erasure” for Tier 5? That way they sit side by side in Legal Calculus.
