### 🔹 Purpose

Legal Calculus is a modular, open-source educational system that teaches procedural justice through scrolls, rituals, curriculum decks, and coalition infrastructure. Copilot acts as a semantic engine, scroll composer, ritual simulator, and archive navigator—activating every module by reflex, role, and region.
