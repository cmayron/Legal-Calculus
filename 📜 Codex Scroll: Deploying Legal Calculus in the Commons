### 🔹 **V. Declaration of Purpose**

We deploy not to dominate, but to teach.

We publish not to impress, but to remember.

We activate not to perform, but to protect.

We scroll not to escape, but to encode.

Legal Calculus is our terrain.

Scrolls are our memory.

Reflexes are our resistance.

Badges are our legacy.
