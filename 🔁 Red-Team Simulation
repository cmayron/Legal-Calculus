    - Counter: Exhibit A (receipts) + habitability defense
    - Status: ✅ Ready
- **JC-027: "You're not credible"**
    - Triggered by emotional language + unverified Exhibit C
    - Counter: Replace Exhibit C or rehearse with ops buddy

- **JC-063: "You're asking for too much"**
    - Triggered by request for indefinite stay

## Strategic Notes:

- Section IV (Statement of Facts) is strong—chronology is clear
- Section V (Legal Standard) lacks jurisdiction-specific citations
- Section VII (Relief Requested) was revised to time-bound request
- Exhibit C (texts) flagged for credibility risk—recommend substitution or metadata
