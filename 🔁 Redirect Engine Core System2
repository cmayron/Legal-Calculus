**Purpose:** Execute real-time procedural redirects—detecting reflexes, activating FG cards, deploying assets, and archiving cognition.

### 🔧 Core Flow

🎯 Reflex → FG Card → Redirect → Asset → Archive → Legacy

🟥 JC-Denial → FG-021 → Refile → Refile Template → LCA → Legacy Page

🟨 JC-Silence → FG-034 → Notice → Notice Template → LCA → Memory Journal

🟥 JC-Default → FG-057 → Default Judgment → Default Template → LCA → Field Log

🟦 LCa-Misalignment → FG-005 → Audit + Refile → Audit Checklist → LCA → Ops Buddy Report

🟥 JC-Erasure → FG-073 → Refile Enhanced → Refile Template → LCA → Doctrine Archive

🟩 LCA-Legacy → FG-099 → Publish Doctrine → Legacy Builder → LC → Commons Manifesto
