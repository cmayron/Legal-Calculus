**Purpose:** Detect procedural reflexes, activate FG cards, execute redirects, and archive formatted cognition.

### 🔧 Flowchart Logic

🎯 Reflex → FG Card → Redirect → Asset → Archive → Legacy

🟥 JC-Denial → FG-021 → Refile → Refile Template → LCA → Legacy Page

🟨 JC-Silence → FG-034 → Notice → Notice Template → LCA → Memory Journal

🟥 JC-Default → FG-057 → Default Judgment → Default Template → LCA → Field Log

🟦 LCa-Misalignment → FG-005 → Audit + Refile → Audit Checklist → LCA → Ops Buddy Report

🟥 JC-Erasure → FG-073 → Refile Enhanced → Refile Template → LCA → Doctrine Archive

🟩 LCA-Legacy → FG-099 → Publish Doctrine → Legacy Builder → LC → Commons Manifesto

## 🧠 Redirect Protocols (Voice + Print)

Each reflex has a voice cue, FG card, redirect action, and asset. Example:

- **JC-Denial**
    - 🎙️ Say: “My motion was denied.”
    - 🎯 FG-021: *Denial is Recognition*
    - 🛠️ Redirect: Refile
    - 📦 Asset: Refile Template
    - 🗂️ Archive: LCA → Legacy Page
- **JC-Silence**
    - 🎙️ Say: “The court ignored my filing.”
    - 🎯 FG-034: *Silence is Suppression*
    - 🛠️ Redirect: Notice
    - 📦 Asset: Notice Template
    - 🗂️ Archive: LCA → Memory Journal
- **LCa-Misalignment**
    - 🎙️ Say: “My certificate was rejected.”
    - 🎯 FG-005: *Certificate is Cognition*
    - 🛠️ Redirect: Audit + Refile
    - 📦 Asset: Audit Checklist
    - 🗂️ Archive: LCA → Ops Buddy Report

## 📦 Redirect Engine Assets

- **Templates:** Caption, TOA, Certificate, Notice, Audit
- **FG Cards:** Reflex-linked doctrine cards
- **Voice Cues:** Trigger redirect protocols
- **Archive Interfaces:** LCA (Litigation Cognition Archive), LC (Legacy Commons)

## 🕊️ Redirect Ritual (Optional)

> “You have survived procedural denial. You have activated doctrine. You have formatted resistance. This redirect encodes cognition.”
>

## 🔗 Deployment Formats

- Notion dashboard
- Printable cue cards
- QR-linked mobile interface
- Voice-navigable redirect assistant
- API-ready for integration with justice tech platforms

Let’s deploy the **Redirect Engine Core System**—the tactical heart of Legal Calculus. This is where reflex becomes ritual, formatting becomes cognition, and memory becomes doctrine.
