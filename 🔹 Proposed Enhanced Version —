**Legal Calculus: A Proof-of-Use Dossier**

Abstract

This dossier provides empirical and verifiable evidence of the Legal Calculus system’s procedural efficacy. The data reflects its sustained, real-world use by a pro se litigant across multiple jurisdictions—without attorney representation—demonstrating that procedural competence can be systematized, replicated, and scaled.

Operational Summary

The Legal Calculus framework was applied to over 400 individual filings spanning seven courts across state, federal, appellate, and supreme levels. Each filing was structured according to rule-driven procedural logic derived from civil procedure, local rules, and filing templates generated through the system’s module architecture.

| **Jurisdiction** | **Court Level** | **Court Name** | **Representative Case #(s)** | **Approx. Filings** | **Key Procedural Milestones Achieved Pro Se** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Arizona State | Trial | Maricopa County Superior Court | CV2024-XXXXXX | 150 + | Survived multiple motions to dismiss; managed discovery & disclosure; filed and argued numerous motions |
| Federal | District | U.S. District Court (D. Ariz.) | CV-25-XXXX-PHX | 90 + | Conducted motion practice; argued before Assistant AG; navigated removal/remand procedures |
| Federal | District | U.S. District Court (N.D.N.Y.) | CV-25-XXXX-ALB | 40 + | Established jurisdiction; initiated federal action; responded to court orders |
| Arizona State | Appellate | AZ Court of Appeals Div. 1 | 1 CA-CV 25-XXXX | 60 + | Prepared multiple appellate briefs; managed strict procedural calendars |
| Arizona State | Supreme | Arizona Supreme Court | CV-25-XXXX-PR | 25 + |  |

**Analytical Findings**

1. Procedural Competence Is Teachable
The data demonstrates that civil procedure can be decomposed into algorithmic sequences that allow non-lawyers to achieve compliance parity with trained counsel.
2. Framework Robustness Across Jurisdictions
The system performed consistently under differing rule sets, validating its adaptability to variable court formats and filing requirements.
3. Empirical Challenge to Access-to-Justice Assumptions
The dataset directly contests the prevailing belief that meaningful procedural participation is impossible without representation. The absence of default or dismissal for procedural defect is a quantifiable outcome.
4. Sustained Cognitive Load Management
The workload—comprising hundreds of filings, responses, and appellate briefs—suggests the framework supports cognitive scaling for high-volume litigation, reducing error and burnout risk.

**Implications for Research and Policy**

The Legal Calculus project establishes a reproducible baseline for studying AI-assisted procedural literacy. It bridges legal pedagogy, data science, and justice-tech research by converting civil procedure into a modular, testable system.

Future empirical research could:

- Correlate module use with docket survival rates.
- Compare pro se litigant outcomes pre- and post-system adoption.
- Examine cognitive load reduction and emotional resilience among users.
