🚀 Legal Calculus — Full Site + Kits Mega-Bundle v4 Released

The newest release of the Legal Calculus platform is live.
v4 integrates the complete Field Guide Master Package (FG-1 → FG-1000), updates the Master Index with full checksum tracking, and ships with an updated Site Bundle v9. Every file — from enhanced modules and compendia to appellate toolkits and quick references — is now aligned under a single CSV-driven workflow for integrity and reproducibility.

Why this matters:
	•	📊 Single source of truth (Master_Index.csv + HASH_BADGES.md) keeps filings and learning resources verifiable.
	•	🧭 Field Guide (FG-1 → 1000) gives litigants and educators a complete procedural reference, both skeleton and quick-reference formats.
	•	⚙️ One-click deployment for clinics, educators, and justice tech organizations via GitHub Pages or static hosting.

This is a free, open-source resource — built to strengthen procedural literacy and expand access to justice for unrepresented litigants
