‚ö†Ô∏è **When you're facing a deadline and navigating court alone** ‚Äî this is your fastest path forward. Remember: **Fix the timeline. Fix the service. Fix the format.**

</aside>

## ‚ö° Immediate Action Steps

- **Step 1: Find Your Task** ‚Äî Open the Field Guide (FG) index and locate the emergency that matches yours (FG-47 TRO Steps, FG-210 Service Checklist, FG-800 Spotting Judicial Bias)
- **Step 2: Fill the Template** ‚Äî Pull the matching template, complete it, add your /s/ e-signature, and export to a locked PDF
- **Step 3: Add Proposed Order** ‚Äî Include a one-line Proposed Order so the court has something concrete to rule on
- **Step 4: Validate & Timestamp** ‚Äî Check your citations and email the PDF to yourself for timestamped proof of diligence
- **Step 5: File It** ‚Äî Submit via ECF if available, otherwise use USPS Certified Mail with Return Receipt Requested

## üõ°Ô∏è Critical Reminders ‚Äî Avoid Common Traps

<aside>
**Three things to fix first:** Timeline, Service, Format ‚Äî these are the top reasons pro se filings get rejected

</aside>

- **Running late?** File a motion for extension the same day you receive the order. Attach the envelope and postmark as proof
- **Repeat filings?** Always state what's new to avoid being labeled "vexatious"
- **Format matters:** Wrong margins, missing name/address block = clerk rejection

## üß† What Makes Legal Calculus Different

Legal Calculus was built by a whistleblower navigating litigation **completely alone** ‚Äî no lawyer, no tech team ‚Äî using GPT-4o, Gemini, and civil procedure rules.

<aside>
**‚úÖ What It Does**
Produces structured motions, declarations, timelines
Preserves appeal rights
Forces judicial response
Translates AI access into justice access

</aside>

<aside>
**‚ùå What It's NOT**
Not legal advice
Not a lawyer replacement
It's **procedural scaffolding** ‚Äî a framework to survive when representation is out of reach

</aside>

## üìö The Philosophy: Format as Power

> **Every filing is a protest.**
Every objection is a memory.
Every record is a remedy.
> 

Legal Calculus doesn't just help you survive the system ‚Äî it helps you **teach it, document it, and build beyond it**.

## üéØ Your Mission Right Now

- [ ]  Archive everything you file ‚Äî use timestamps, save PDFs, keep receipts
- [ ]  Document patterns ‚Äî if you see obstruction, silence, or procedural traps, write them down
- [ ]  Build your record ‚Äî the archive **is** your appeal

<aside>
üí° **Remember:** Procedural literacy is the #1 barrier for pro se litigants. No other free resource combines full procedural curriculum with court-ready outputs. You're not alone ‚Äî and your documentation matters.
