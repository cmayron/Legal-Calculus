### 🔍 JC Reflex Comparison

**Table: What the court did vs. what it should have done**

| Filing | Court Response | JC Reflex | Redirect Tactic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Motion to Compel | Denied without explanation | Denial | FG-021: *Denial is Recognition* |
| Notice of Default | Ignored | Silence | FG-034: *Silence is Suppression* |
| Motion for Summary Judgment | Dismissed as premature | Positional | FG-062: *Timing is Framing* |

### 🧠 FGA Checklist Generator

**Advanced diagnostics for complex filings**

Use this section to build layered checklists based on:

- Filing type (motion, notice, complaint)
- Court level (state, federal, appellate)
- Reflex risk (denial, silence, ambiguity)

**Example: Motion to Reconsider**

- [ ]  Caption with case number and judge name
- [ ]  TOA citing prior denial
- [ ]  Certificate of Service
- [ ]  JC Reflex trigger: Denial → FG-021
- [ ]  Archive for memory → LCA

### 🔁 Semantic Feedback Loop

**AI explains why filings failed and how to reframe**

**Example:**

> “Your motion was denied without explanation. This triggers JC-Denial. According to FG-021, denial is recognition. You should refile with enhanced formatting and archive the reflex.”
> 

**Redirect Flow:**

1. Detect JC reflex
2. Match FG card
3. Reframe filing using template
4. Archive and escalate if needed
