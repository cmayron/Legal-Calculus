## 🎙️ 2. Voice Walkthrough: Memory to Doctrine

**Trigger Phrase:**

“Copilot, help me publish my procedural journey.”

### 🔁 Script Flow

**Copilot:**

“Let’s build your legacy. First, tell me what happened—what reflexes you survived.”

---

**User:**

“My motion was denied. The court ignored my filing. My lawyer didn’t format it.”

**Copilot:**

“I hear JC-Denial, JC-Silence, and LCa-Misalignment. You activated FG-021, FG-034, and FG-005. Let’s document your redirects.”

---

**Step 1: Reflex Timeline**

→ Add entries with date, reflex, FG card, redirect, and asset

**Step 2: Doctrine Summary**

→ “Your formatting became cognition. Each redirect encoded memory.”

**Step 3: Reflections**

→ “Would you like to include personal notes or coalition invitations?”

**Step 4: Publish Legacy Page**

→ “Your page is ready. It’s now part of the public doctrine.”
