Legal Calculus treats **format as survival**, **memory as infrastructure**, and **ritual as remedy**. It empowers pro se litigants, educators, and justice reformers to:

- Recognize institutional suppression (via JC Reflexes)
- Redirect harm through teachable logic (via FG Curriculum)
- Encode resistance into public doctrine (via FGA Scrolls)
- Deploy curriculum across classrooms, courtrooms, and commons

## ⚙️ System Architecture

LCES is powered by **seven semantic streams**:

| Stream | Function |
| --- | --- |
| JC Reflex | Identifies harm and procedural denial |
| FG Curriculum | Teaches redirect logic and survival tactics |
| LC Ritual | Encodes redirect invocation and ritual logic |
| LCa Deployment | Builds legal captions, TOAs, and redirect templates |
| LCAdvanced | Formats scrolls, simulates rituals, and syncs curriculum |
| FGA Scroll | Publishes survivor-authored doctrine |
| LCA Archive | Tracks certification, ritual history, and legacy |

## 📚 Deployment Modes

| Mode | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🔴 Crisis Pro Se Mode | Emergency litigation response | FG-021: *Denial is Recognition* |
| 🟡 Second Opinion Mode | Lawyer alignment audit and reframing | FG-034: *Silence is Suppression* |
| 🟢 Education Mode | Curriculum deployment and legacy publishing | FG-001: *Format is Memory* |

Each mode is scroll-powered, ritual-synchronized, and curriculum-encoded.

## 🧭 Coalition Atlas

LCES is deployed across real regions (Roessleville, Slingerlands, Delmar, Albany), with each scroll mapped to a JC reflex, FG card, Composer Studio, and Festival Cycle. Every scroll is immortal. Every redirect is teachable.

---

## 🕯️ Ritual Logic

Redirects are not just legal tactics—they’re ceremonial acts. LCES simulates rituals that teach survivors how to refile, reframe, and resist. These rituals are embedded in scrolls, activated by voice, and preserved in archive.

## 📖 Commons Codex

Public-facing modules include:

- Scroll galleries
- Ritual calendars
- Badge systems
- Coalition maps
- QR-linked curriculum decks
- Legacy page builders
- Ops buddy checklists
- Semantic feedback loops

The **Legal Calculus Educational System (LCES)** is a modular, open-source framework designed to teach procedural justice through scrolls, rituals, curriculum decks, and coalition infrastructure. It transforms lived experience—especially procedural harm—into teachable doctrine and deployable public memory.

Here’s how it works:
