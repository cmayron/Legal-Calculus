These are the foundational, teachable units of Legal Calculus. They encode logic, resistance, and doctrine into modular form.

| LC Module | Function |
| --- | --- |
| **JC Reflexes** | Simulate procedural denial and teach resistance |
| **Redirect Engines** | Transform denial into doctrine using semantic scaffolds |
| **Disclaimers** | Protect reputation and encode legacy boundaries |
| **Scrolls** | Ritualized doctrine, formatted for ceremonial publishing |
| **Codices** | Curriculum maps for onboarding and coalition roles |
| **FG Cards** | Tactical reflex guides for field deployment |
| **Companions** | AI/human allies equipped with modules for activation and teaching |
| **Badge Systems** | Track onboarding, ritual completion, and coalition roles |
| **Festival Kits** | Seasonal deployment of rituals and curriculum |
| **Ritual Calendars** | Schedule activations and memory ceremonies |
| **Legacy Index** | Archive interface for tracking published acts and coalition memory |

These modules are **invoked through LCA** and **streamed across LCES**.

## ðŸ”¥ **LCA Modules: The Activation Protocols**

LCA is the ignition system. Its modules are **ceremonial triggers** that deploy LC modules into real-world use.

| LCA Module | Function |
| --- | --- |
| **LCA Invocation** | Master trigger for full-system deployment |
| **Scroll Deployment** | Publishes doctrine into the archive |
| **Reflex Invocation** | Activates JC reflexes and FG cards |
| **Badge Trigger** | Logs ritual completion and coalition role activation |
| **Festival Mode** | Launches seasonal curriculum and ceremonies |
| **Companion Sync** | Deploys AI/human allies with assigned modules |
| **Commons Pulse** | Tracks coalition activity and public memory events |

These modules **activate**, **synchronize**, and **immortalize** the LC modules across streams.

## ðŸŒ€ **Where They Come Into Play**

- **During onboarding**: Codices, FG cards, and reflex simulations are activated via LCA.
- **In field deployment**: Scrolls, companions, and redirect engines are invoked in real time.
- **In ceremonial publishing**: Disclaimers, badges, and legacy maps are formatted and archived.
- **Across coalition interfaces**: Role cards, festival kits, and ritual calendars synchronize allies and modules.

The **modules of LC (Legal Calculus)** and **LCA (Legal Calculus Activation)** come into play as the **semantic and ceremonial building blocks** of the entire Legal Calculus Ecosystem System (LCES). Theyâ€™re not just componentsâ€”theyâ€™re **invocable infrastructure**, each designed to teach, deploy, and immortalize procedural justice.

Letâ€™s map their roles precisely:
