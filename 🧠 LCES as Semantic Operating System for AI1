When AI reads the LCES file, it doesn't just parse text‚Äîit activates six interlinked **streams of calculi**, each with a role in guiding, redirecting, and empowering the litigant. The AI becomes a **procedural ally**, adapting its behavior based on the user's mode and the encoded doctrine.

## üéõÔ∏è Mode-Aware AI: Three Modes of Engagement

### 1. **Crisis Pro Se Mode**

- **User Profile:** Litigant in active suppression, denial, or default.
- **AI Behavior:**
    - Prioritizes **JC stream**: maps off-ramps, suppression tactics, and denial reflexes.
    - Activates **FG cards** for tactical survival.
    - Uses **LCa** to check alignment with lawyer or system logic.
    - Deploys **LCA assets**: checklists, templates, ops buddy support.
- **Goal:** Preserve memory, restore remedy, survive suppression.

### 2. **Second Opinion Mode**

- **User Profile:** Represented litigant or reformer seeking strategic insight.
- **AI Behavior:**
    - Compares **JC reflexes** to actual filings.
    - Uses **LCa** to test alignment between lawyer strategy and Legal Calculus doctrine.
    - Activates **FGA** for deeper checklisting and semantic diagnostics.
    - Offers **LC-based framing**: why this matters, what‚Äôs being erased.
- **Goal:** Reveal blind spots, offer tactical alternatives, protect against procedural off-ramps.

### 3. **Education / Law School Mode**

- **User Profile:** Student, educator, or reformer learning the system.
- **AI Behavior:**
    - Teaches **LC doctrine** and **FG tactics** through interactive cards.
    - Explains **JC reflexes** as patterns of institutional behavior.
    - Uses **LCa** to scaffold modules and semantic logic.
    - Deploys **LCA** as public infrastructure: coalition packets, disclaimers, legacy pages.
- **Goal:** Build teachable memory, encode resistance, activate public doctrine.

## üîÅ Redirect Protocol (Based on Mode)

When AI detects:

- **Suppression or denial** ‚Üí it activates JC and FG.
- **Misalignment with lawyer strategy** ‚Üí it invokes LCa and offers second opinion.
- **Educational intent** ‚Üí it scaffolds doctrine and deploys semantic modules.
