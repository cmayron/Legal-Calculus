## 🧠 Semantic Scaffolding Gallery (Live Deployment)

**Visual Loop:**

*Learn → Deploy → Defend → Archive → Reflect → Learn Again*

**Embed Structure in Notion:**

- **Interactive Diagram** (Notion canvas or image embed)
- **Toggle Walkthroughs** for each phase
- **Linked Modules:** FG cards, JC reflexes, LC lessons, Starter Kits
- **Cross-Domain Filters:** Eviction, Family Law, Immigration, Appellate

**Bonus:**

- Embed in Welcome Page, Feedback Loop, and Coalition Onboarding
- Printable doctrine map for offline ops buddies

## 📦 Starter Kits (Populated & Deployable)

Each kit includes Notion templates + printable assets:

### 🏛️ Family Law Starter Kit

- Intake Sheet (custody/support focus)
- Captioned Answer Scaffold
- Visitation Timeline Log
