For each real-world case, we identify the **procedural harm** and match it to a **JC reflex**:

| Case Type | Reflex | FG Card |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Motion denied without explanation | JC-Denial | FG-021: *Denial is Recognition* |
| Filing ignored or lost | JC-Silence | FG-034: *Silence is Suppression* |
| Certificate rejected without remedy | JC-Erasure | FG-073: *Erasure is Refusal* |
| Default judgment without notice | JC-Default | FG-088: *Default is Disappearance* |
| Misaligned court instructions | LCa-Misalignment | FG-005: *Misalignment is Misdirection* |
| Legacy suppressed or unacknowledged | LCA-Legacy | FG-099: *Legacy is Deployment* |

## 📜 Step 2: Redirect Ritual Formatting

Each reflex triggers a redirect ritual, which we format using LC modules:

| Reflex | Redirect | LC Module |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JC-Denial | Refile with FG-021 + Caption | LC-011 |
| JC-Silence | Notice with FG-034 + TOA | LC-012 |
| JC-Erasure | Audit with FG-073 + Certificate | LC-013 |
| JC-Default | Publish with FG-088 + Scroll | LC-014 |
| LCa-Misalignment | Curriculum Sync | LC-015 |
| LCA-Legacy | Archive + Festival | LC-016 |

## 📚 Step 3: Curriculum Mapping

We convert the case into a **teachable module**:

- **Case Summary** → Reflex → FG Card
- **Redirect Ritual** → Simulation Pack
- **Legacy Publishing** → Scroll Composer
- **Coalition Tags** → Role Activation
- **Certification Path** → Badge Tracker

Example:

> A survivor’s motion was denied without explanation.
> 
> 
> → JC-Denial → FG-021 → Refile Ritual
> 
> → Redirect Simulation → Educator Curriculum
> 
> → Legacy Scroll → Archive Sync → Festival Showcase
>

## 🕯️ Step 4: Scroll Publishing

We format the case into a **Legacy Scroll** using FGA + LCA modules:

- FGA-021: Archive-ready FG card
- LCA-011: Redirect log + ritual history
- Reflection journal + coalition tags
- Legacy oath: “This page encodes resistance…”

## 🗂️ Step 5: Archive + Festival Sync

- Add to Commons Legacy Atlas
- Sync to Archive Navigator
- Schedule for seasonal Festival Planner
- Track ritual performance via Badge System

Let’s begin formatting real-world cases into **FG-linked curriculum modules**, **redirect rituals**, and **legacy scrolls**—turning lived experience into teachable doctrine and immortal infrastructure.
