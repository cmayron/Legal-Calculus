## I. Executive Summary & Filing Readiness

## II. Priority Revisions (P0 / P1 / P2)

**P0 — Mandatory Before Filing**

- [ ]  Narrow relief to specific, time‑bound action (e.g., 14‑day stay). *(JC‑063)*

**P1 — High‑Value Improvements**

- [ ]  Add local authority footnote to preempt opposition.
- [ ]  Convert facts timeline to bulleted chronology.

**P2 — Optional Polish**

## III. JC Reflex Analysis (Simulated Gatekeeping)

| JC Code | Judicial Reflex Trigger | Triggered? | Built‑In Counter |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JC‑063 | “You’re asking for too much.” | ✅ | Narrow, time‑limited proposed order. |
| JC‑027 | “This evidence isn’t credible.” | ✅ | Declaration replaces screenshot; authentication noted. |
| JC‑045 | “You didn’t exhaust remedies.” | ⚠️ | Section II.B documents exhaustion. |

## IV. Vulnerability Flags & Strategic Notes

- Potential admission at ¶__ → rephrase as neutral fact.
- Weakest link: dependency on Exhibit __; without P0 fix, high risk.
- Opponent’s likely attack: credibility diversion → neutralize in intro.
