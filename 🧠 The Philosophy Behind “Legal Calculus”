Ready-to-paste academic abstract (150 words)

Legal Calculus 4.5 Advanced operationalizes procedural justice through verifiable records and public memory. The curriculum integrates AI-legible drafting (PDF/A, bookmarks, data manifests), chain-verified factual citations (ECF pin-cites; SHA-256 exhibit hashes), and evidentiary data summaries (FRE 1006) to convert anecdotal delay into contestable proof. A modular designâ€”eight tiers from foundational format to coalition memoryâ€”pairs Option A/B micro-orders with role-specific toolkits for pro se litigants, clinics, journalists, and chambers. The public Archive Pack (Top-10 PDF/A, index.csv, manifest) enables strangers to verify claims in two clicks, scaling trust via hash-witnesses and mirrored repositories. Program KPIs (time-to-docket/order; verified-exhibits; coalition actions) quantify impact. By teaching disciplined filing, calendaring, and publication, Legal Calculus reframes filings as protest and memory as remedy, offering a scalable, evidence-first model for procedural reform.
