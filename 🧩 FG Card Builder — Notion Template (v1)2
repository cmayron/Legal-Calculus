# FG-223 • Docket Delay/Return — Demand Docket Entry or Written Order

**Action Steps**

- File Notice of Filing & Request for Docket Clarification with proofs
- Request docket entry or signed written order
- Preserve original filing date (postmark/submission ID)
- Concurrent corrected re-filing (without waiving the original date)
- Start T+3/T+7 docket-watch rhythm

**One-liner Counter (hallway-ready)**

“Either docket the papers or issue a signed written order; my filing date is [DATE] and must be preserved.”

**Anchors (LC/FG/Rule)**

FG-001 Existence by Filing; FG-004 Silence≠Settlement; FG-010 Certificate of Service; local docket-first/cure-later rule (cite)

**JC Reflex + counter**

- JC-01 Docket Delay=Suppression → Notice + proofs; demand docket or signed order; preserve date
- JC-02 Administrative Return (No Order) → Same + proposed minute order

**LCa Tactic + counter**

- LCa-20 Local-Rule Ambush → Corrected refiling + substantial compliance; decide on merits
- LCa-16 Service Defect Exploit → Cure fast; deem prior date preserved

**FG Core**

If the court won’t docket, force a choice: docket now or issue a signed refusal—and lock in your original date.

**FG Lesson**

A notice with proofs converts clerk silence into a docket entry or a judicial decision. Always preserve the original date and re-file a corrected copy if needed.

**FG Assignment**

Draft a 6-line Notice listing submission method/date, attaching proof, requesting docket entry or signed order, and preserving the original filing date.

**FG Model Answer**

“Plaintiff submitted the [Complaint/Motion] via [method] on [DATE] (Exh. A). As of [today], no docket entry appears. Please docket forthwith or issue a signed order stating the basis for refusal. Plaintiff preserves the filing date of [DATE]. A corrected copy is filed concurrently without waiver.”

**FGA Expanded Notes**

Keep tone neutral; include a 1-paragraph proposed minute order; use two-track outcome (docket or written order); maintain archive discipline with PDFs/screens; an ops buddy can run T+3/T+7 checks.
