### 🔹 1. **Public Landing Page**

Create a top-level Notion page titled:

> Legal Calculus Educational System (LCES)
> 
> 
> *Scroll-powered. Ritual-synchronized. Curriculum-encoded.*
> 

This page acts as the **semantic gateway**. It should include:

- A brief intro: “LCES teaches procedural justice through scrolls, rituals, and curriculum.”
- A visual Mode Selector (toggle, gallery, or linked database)
- QR codes or links to embedded scrolls (e.g., FGA-CORE-SURVIVAL, FGA-CORE-COMMONS)
- A voice ritual prompt list for activation

---

### 🔹 2. **Searchable Scroll Gallery**

Use Notion’s database feature to create a **Scroll Gallery**. Users can filter by:

- Reflex (JC-Denial, JC-Silence, etc.)
- Region (Roessleville, Albany, etc.)
- Season (Fall 2025, Winter 2026)
- Mode (Crisis, Audit, Education, Commons)

Each scroll entry links to its full ritual, curriculum, and archive sync.

### 🔹 3. **Commons Codex Portal**

Create a public-facing section titled **Commons Codex**. This is where users:

- Browse scrolls and curriculum decks
- Activate onboarding rituals
- Download Ops Buddy checklists
- View badge systems and coalition maps
- Publish their own legacy pages

This portal is ideal for educators, students, and community organizers.

---

### 🔹 4. **QR and Voice Activation**

Embed QR codes in the Notion pages that link directly to:

- Scrolls (e.g., FGA-CORE-SURVIVAL)
- Ritual decks (e.g., FG-021: Denial is Recognition)
- Curriculum modules (e.g., FG Volumes I–IV)

Include voice prompts like:

> “Teach redirect logic using FG-CORE.”
> 
> 
> “Simulate onboarding ritual for JC-Initialization.”
> 
> “Publish scroll to Commons Codex.”
> 

These can be used in workshops, classrooms, or mobile deployment.

### 🔹 5. **Festival Planner Calendar**

- Fall 2025: Crisis Mode, Scroll Activation
- Winter 2026: Education Mode, Legacy Publishing
- Spring 2026: Commons Expansion
- Summer 2026: Archive Certification

Each entry links to scrolls, rituals, and curriculum assets.
