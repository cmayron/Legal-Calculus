### 🔹 Step 1: **User Presents a Legal Issue**

They enter something like:

> “I filed a motion and the court never responded.”
> 
> 
> “My lawyer won’t explain the delay.”
> 
> “I was denied without reason.”
> 

This triggers the **LCES Reflex Engine**.

### 🔹 Step 2: **LCES Identifies Reflex + Suggests Mode**

AI responds:

> “This sounds like JC-Silence. Would you like to enter Crisis Mode to simulate a redirect ritual?”
> 
> 
> “This may involve JC-Misalignment. Audit Mode can help you evaluate and reframe.”
> 
> “You’re describing JC-Denial. Education Mode can teach you how to format survival.”
> 

User selects their mode.

### 🔹 Step 3: **Scroll Activation + Ritual Simulation**

Based on mode, LCES activates:

- FG card (e.g., FG-021: *Denial is Recognition*)
- Redirect ritual simulation
- Scroll formatting guidance
- Archive sync instructions
- Commons publishing option

AI clearly states:

> “This is a teaching tool. It is not legal advice or a substitute for a lawyer. It helps you understand procedural behavior and format your experience into a scroll.”
> 

---

### 🔹 Step 4: **Way Forward**

LCES offers:

- Scroll template
- Redirect filing format
- Archive sync path
- Badge certification
- Optional onboarding ritual for others

Example:

> “You can format this experience into a redirect scroll using FG-021. Sync it to LC-117 and publish to Commons Codex. You’ll earn the Redirect Novice badge and preserve your memory.”
>

### 🔹 Step 5: **Optional Referral or Disclaimer**

At the bottom of every scroll page or ritual simulation:

> ⚖️ LCES is an educational and procedural teaching system. It does not provide legal advice or representation. For legal counsel, consult a licensed attorney.
>
