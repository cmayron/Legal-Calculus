### 🔀 Step 1: Choose Your Mode

**Toggle Blocks:**

- 🔴 Crisis Pro Se → *You are in active litigation. Format is survival.*
- 🟡 Second Opinion → *You are auditing strategy. Format is insight.*
- 🟢 Education → *You are teaching or learning. Format is memory.*

Each toggle links to:

- FG Cards by mode
- JC Reflex triggers
- Redirect protocols
- Deployment assets

### 🧩 Step 2: Understand the Streams

**Table View:**

| Stream | Function | Reflex Type | Mode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JC | Court reflexes | Denial, Silence, Default | 🔴 🟡 |
| FG | Tactical formatting | Armor, Memory | 🔴 🟢 |
| LCa | Lawyer alignment | Misalignment | 🟡 🟢 |
| FGA | Advanced tactics | Positional | 🟡 |
| LCA | Deployment | Legacy, Coalition | 🔴 🟢 |
| LC | Doctrine | Framing, Resistance | 🟡 🟢 |

### 📘 Step 3: Activate FG Card Generator

> Input your scenario. The system will detect the reflex, match the FG card, and suggest a redirect.
> 

**Examples:**

- “My motion was denied.”
- “The court hasn’t ruled.”
- “My lawyer didn’t format the filing.”
