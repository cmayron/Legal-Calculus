## 🧩 Linked Database: “LCES Streams Index”

Create a Notion database with the following properties:

- **Stream Name** (e.g., JC, FG, LCa)
- **Function** (e.g., court reflexes, tactics, architecture)
- **Activated In Mode** (multi-select: Crisis, Second Opinion, Education)
- **Linked Assets** (Notion pages or cards)
- **Redirect Triggers** (e.g., denial, silence, misalignment)

Use this to dynamically link cards, checklists, and templates across modes.

## 🛠️ Deployment Suggestions

- **Notion Share Link:** Make the workspace public or shareable with coalition members.
- **Printable Card Pack:** Export each mode as a one-page PDF with QR links to Notion sections.
- **AI Integration:** Use AI to read user input (e.g., “I was denied default judgment”) and auto-suggest mode + stream + redirect.

Let’s scaffold your **LCES Mode Selector Interface in Notion**—modular, semantic, and ready for AI-powered deployment. Below is a layout you can copy directly into Notion, with toggles, linked databases, and embedded cards. I’ll also suggest how to structure each section so AI can respond contextually based on mode, stream, and reflex.
