# **🧭 Choose Your Mode (Card Grid)**

LC — Foundations

For first‑time users. Filing hygiene, timelines, service, relief, evidence.

LCA — Advanced

Complex litigation. Lawfare resistance, TRO/PI, Younger, record‑first strategy.

FG — Field Guide

1‑page task cards (serve by mail, compute time, tailor relief, etc.).

FGA — Field Guide Advanced

Deep‑dive cards for edge cases and expert workflows.

JC — Judicial Calculus

Map system behavior; appeals posture; archive‑as‑remedy.

LCa — Lawyer Calculus

Clinics/pro bono workflows, QA checklists, review templates.

# Replace each title with a link to the target page when ready.

# **🗺️ System Map**

- Filing = Protest. Format = Memory. The Record = Remedy.
- Cookbook → templated filings + scripts → deterministic steps where rules are computable.
- Human‑Judgment Zones → factor checklists + short, cited reasoning.
- Archive → every output yields evidence for review, reconsideration, appeal.

# **🧼 Filing Hygiene (Quick Checklist)**

- TNRPESC: Timing • Narrative • Relief • Procedure • Evidence • Service • Citations
- Captions, signatures, proposed orders ✅
- Mailbox‑rule receipts, tracking, and labeled exhibits ✅
- Keep an Updates Log and a Service Ledger ✅

# **⚙️ Law as Computation (Module)**

Make the computable parts of law executable, verifiable, and appealable—while clearly marking Human‑Judgment Zones.

Minimal architecture

1. Rule Spec (DSL/pseudocode + tests; version + hash)
2. Evidence Pipeline (normalize inputs; timestamps, links, hashes)
3. Decision Function (deterministic; emit intermediate steps)
4. Audit Layer (human‑readable trace + reconsideration/appeal hooks)
5. Public Archive (publish spec/tests/anonymized traces)

Example — Computation of Time

Inputs: service date, method, tolling intervals, holidays →

Output: last day to file with a step‑by‑step trace of counted/excluded days.

Determination Trace — paste into each task

- Issue
- Governing Rule (pinpoint)
- Inputs (with sources & hashes)
- Steps (numbered)
- Result
- Human‑Judgment Zone: factors + short reasoning
- Next Actions: rehearing/appeal paths + dates
- Attachments: exhibits, test vector, spec version ID

Mini‑Spec (YAML) — Notion code block

module: computation_of_time_v1

effective: 2025-09-24

inputs:

filing_event_date: date

service_date: date

method_of_service: [personal, mail, electronic]

tolling_events: [{start: date, end: date, reason: string}]

court_holidays: [date]

weekend_rule: boolean

logic:

base_deadline = service_date + rule_days(method_of_service)

for e in tolling_events:

base_deadline += days_between(e.start, e.end)

if weekend_rule and is_weekend_or_holiday(base_deadline, court_holidays):

base_deadline = next_business_day(base_deadline, court_holidays)

outputs:

last_day_to_file: base_deadline

trace:

- "Compute base days from service"

- "Add tolling intervals"

- "Adjust to next business day if needed"

review_hooks:

reconsideration: "New tolling evidence or holiday miscalc"

appeal: "Attach trace + governing text"

tests:

- name: mail_service_weekend_roll

input: {...}

expect: { last_day_to_file: "2025-10-13" }
