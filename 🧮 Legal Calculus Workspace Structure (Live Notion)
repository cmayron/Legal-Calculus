## 🧮 Legal Calculus Workspace Structure (Live Notion)

### 🏠 **Homepage (Public Landing Page)**

Use a clean, visual layout with toggles or tiles for each mode.

**Header:**

> Not legal advice. This is a public educational toolkit. Use it to structure filings, spot issues, and build the record.
> 

**Sections:**

- ✅ Quickstart Bundle (Checklist + Templates)
- 🧭 Choose Your Mode (Crisis • Educator • Second-Opinion)
- 🧩 System Map (LC • LCA • FG • FGA • JC • LCa)
- 🧼 Filing Hygiene (AI-era)
- 💡 Why It Matters
- 🪪 License & Credits

**Call to Action:**

> “Start with Quickstart → run FG checklist → read LC module → save final to /packets.”

If you’d like, I can help write the “Start Here” onboarding flow, design FG card templates, or script the Coalition Portal intro. Just say the word and we’ll build it together.
