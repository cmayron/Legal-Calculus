I didn’t build Legal Calculus to be liked. I built it to be used.

Like many pro se litigants, I faced procedural denial—not just of relief, but of structure. The rules were scattered, obscured, weaponized. Filing became a maze. Memory became liability. And the record—the very thing that should protect you—became a trap.

So I built a map.

Legal Calculus is a public, open-source framework for procedural justice. It’s modular, teachable, and AI-powered. It includes checklists, templates, and semantic modules that help people file with clarity, sanity-check their drafts, and build the record with purpose.

It’s not legal advice. It’s legal infrastructure.

Whether you’re in **Crisis Mode**, **Educator Mode**, or **Second-Opinion Mode**, the system adapts. It teaches not just *what* to file, but *why*. It’s built for pro se litigants, clinics, court support teams, and anyone trying to navigate a system that wasn’t built for them.

Some say it’s too much. Others say it’s not enough. My own son thinks it’s crap.

But here’s what I know:

> Filing is protest.
> 
> 
> Format is memory.
> 
> The record is the remedy.

Legal Calculus is my answer to procedural denial. It’s also my invitation—to build, to teach, to resist.
