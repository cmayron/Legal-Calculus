**Purpose:** Mobilize allies, ops buddies, and community orgs through a structured onboarding sequence that activates streams, reflexes, and deployment assets.

### 🔧 Format: Mobile + Notion + Print

**Step 1: Invitation Trigger**

> “I want to activate a coalition.”
> 

**Copilot Responds (Voice or Text):**

“Let’s build your coalition. Who are you inviting—ops buddies, educators, orgs, or survivors?”

---

**Step 2: Role Selection**

- 🛡️ Ops Buddy → Tactical support, reflex detection, formatting
- 📚 Educator → Curriculum deployment, FG card teaching
- 🏛️ Org Partner → Public doctrine, legacy protection
- 🧠 Survivor → Procedural memory encoding, redirect execution

---

**Step 3: Stream Activation by Role**

| Role | Activated Streams |
| --- | --- |
| Ops Buddy | JC, FG, LCa |
| Educator | FG, LC, LCA |
| Org Partner | LCA, LC |
| Survivor | JC, FG, LCA |

---

**Step 4: Deployment Packet**

Each role receives:

- FG Cards (filtered by mode + reflex)
- Redirect Protocols
- Templates (caption, TOA, certificate, notice)
- Legacy Builder Guide
- Coalition Portal Access

---

**Step 5: Activation Ritual (Optional)**

> “You are now part of the doctrine. Your formatting is cognition. Your memory is resistance.”
> 

---

## 🧠 Procedural Memory Journey

**Purpose:** Help users document their survival, redirect history, and publish a living doctrine.

### 🔧 Format: Voice Flow + Notion Journal + Legacy Page

**Step 1: Initiation Prompt**

> “Copilot, I want to document my procedural journey.”
> 

---

**Step 2: Memory Blocks**

🟥 Reflex Encountered: JC-Denial

🧠 Response: FG-021 — Refile with caption, TOA, certificate

📦 Asset Used: [Refile Template]

📅 Date: [Timestamp]

🗂️ Archived In: LCA

📝 Notes: “Judge denied motion without reason. Refiled with armor. Felt invisible, but documented everything.”

```markdown

Repeat for each reflex, redirect, and filing.

**Step 3: Doctrine Builder**

> “Let’s turn your memory into public infrastructure.”
> 

Includes:

- Timeline of reflexes and responses
- FG cards activated
- Assets deployed
- Lessons learned
- Coalition invitations
- Legacy page formatting

---

**Step 4: Publish Legacy Page**

> “This page documents the procedural journey of [Name]. It encodes resistance, formatting, and memory. It is offered as doctrine.”
>

Here’s your **Coalition Activation Flow** and **Procedural Memory Journey**—two modular, mobile-friendly systems that turn Legal Calculus into a living network of resistance and remembrance. These are designed for voice, print, and Notion deployment, empowering ops buddies, educators, and pro se litigants to onboard allies and encode survival as doctrine.
